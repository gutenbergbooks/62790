<h2><a name="Publishers_Preface" id="Publishers_Preface">Publishers' Preface</a></h2>


<p>The plan of this work contemplates a short,
timely nature story, or seasonable hint for every
calendar day in the year, telling the reader just
what time in the successive seasons to look for
the different birds, beasts, flowers, etc., how to
recognize and study them when taking observation
walks for pleasure or instruction. Recognition
of different creatures, etc., is assisted by numerous
excellent illustrations, and alternate pages
are left blank for reader's notes or record of
things seen. A yearly report so kept, either by
a single young person or a small group or club,
cannot fail to be a source of continuous interest,
not only while being made but after its completion.
A club competing for the best and complete
record so made should produce pleasure and instruction
throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Dedication</h2>


<p><i>This book is dedicated to my first wild pet, who was
the most interesting and intelligent creature I have
tamed. He chased the children into their houses
by pinching their legs; he awoke the dog by pulling
its tail, and he pecked the horse's feet, then jumped
back and crouched low to escape being kicked.
Because of his thieving instinct he kept me at war
with the neighbors. His last mischievous act was
to pull the corks from the red and the black ink
bottles, tip them over, fly to the bed, and cover the
counterpane with tracks. I found him dead in the
work-room the following morning, his black beak
red and red mouth black.</i></p>

<h2>Preface</h2>


<p>This little book was written for the lover of
outdoor life who has neither the time nor the
patience to study natural history. There are many
persons who are anxious to learn the common
animals and flowers, their haunts and their habits,
that they may enjoy Nature when they visit her.
If they will take a minute each day to read the
entry for that date, or if they will carry the book
with them on their strolls into the country and
while resting turn its pages, it may prove the means
of discovering in fur or feather or flowering bud
something before unknown to them.</p>

<p>The subjects chosen are of common interest, and
nearly all can be found by any person who hunts
for them assiduously. As the seasons vary in
different localities, it has been impossible to set a
date for the appearance or disappearance of an
animal or a flower, that will apply alike to all parts
of the country for which this volume is intended.
Eastern United States.</p>

<h2><a name="January" id="January"><span class="antiqua">January</span></a></h2>


<h3>January First</h3>

<p>The best New Year's resolution a lover of nature
can make, is a promise to provide the feathered
waifs of winter with free lunches. This may be
done by fastening pieces of suet to limbs and trunks
of trees, and by placing sunflower seeds, bird seeds,
or cracked nuts on the veranda roof or on the
window-sill of your room, where sharp eyes will
soon spy them.</p>


<h3>January Second</h3>

<p>Your boarders will be the birds that either remain
with you throughout the year, or have come
from the frozen North to spend the winter. These
are the birds that feed upon seeds of various kinds,
or the feathered carpenters that pry into the crevices
of the bark, and dig into the rotten wood in search
of the insects and the insect larvæ hidden there.</p>


<h3>January Third</h3>

<p>The chickadee, white-breasted nuthatch, and the
downy woodpecker, keep company during the long
winter months. They will appreciate your lunches
most, and will call on you frequently throughout
the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span></p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span></p>

<h3>January Fourth</h3>

<p>Do not attempt to tame your visitors until they
have made several calls for lunches. Then put a
crude "dummy," with a false face, near the
window, and raise the sash to let the birds enter.
Within a few days the chickadees will perch upon
Dummy's shoulders and take nut meats from his
buttonholes.</p>


<h3>January Fifth</h3>

<p>Having thus gained the chickadees' confidence,
hurry to the window when you hear them call, and
quietly take the place of the dummy. Of course
they will be suspicious at first, and probably you
will meet with many disappointments, but when
you have succeeded in taming them to alight upon
your hand or shoulder, you will find enjoyment in
calling them to you by the gentle whistle to which
you should accustom them.</p>


<h3>January Sixth</h3>

<p>Tempting food, and slow movements when in
the presence of birds, are the main secrets to successful
bird taming. The chickadee, as you will
find, is the easiest of these birds to tame. He has
several songs and call notes, so do not expect
always to hear him repeat his name, "<i>chick-a-de-de-de-de</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span></p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span></p>

<h3>January Seventh</h3>

<p>Persons not familiar with birds often mistake the
white-breasted nuthatch for a woodpecker, for
their actions are much alike. The nuthatch creeps
about the trees in all kinds of attitudes, while the
woodpecker assumes an upright position most of
the time and moves in spasmodic hops. The
young and the female downy woodpecker do not
have the red crescent on the back of the head. The
hairy woodpecker is another "resident" that looks
like his cousin, the downy, but he is once again as
large.</p>


<h3>January Eighth</h3>

<p>Winter in the North is a season of hardship and
hunger to wild creatures. The otherwise wary and
cunning crow often puts discretion aside when in
search of food, and fearlessly visits the village
refuse heaps, or the farmer's barn-yard. In the
orchards you will find where he has uncovered the
decayed apples and pecked holes into them.</p>


<h3>January Ninth</h3>

<p>Even the mink, after days of fasting, is driven by
starvation to leave his retreat in a burrow along a
creek or river bank, and to forage upon the farmer's
poultry. Poor fellow, he does not hibernate, so
he must have food; fish is his choice, but when
hard pressed, he will take anything, "fish, flesh, or
fowl."</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span></p>

<h3>January Tenth</h3>

<p>In the fields and lowlands, the scattered coveys
of Bob-whites that have escaped the hunter, huddle
for shelter from a storm under a stump or in a
hollow log. Sometimes several days pass before
they are able to dig through the drifts that imprison
them. Should a heavy sleet-storm cover the snowy
mantle with a crust too thick and hard for them to
break through, starvation is their fate. Sportsmen
living within convenient reach of quail coverts
should watch over them in such weather and provide
food and shelter for the birds.</p>

<h3>January Eleventh</h3>

<p>Even the flocks of horned (or shore) larks that
feed on the wind-swept hilltops, pause occasionally
and squat close to the ground to keep from being
blown away. They have come from the North, and
after passing the winter with us, most of them will
return to Canada to nest.</p>

<h3>January Twelfth</h3>

<p>A long period of cold freezes the marshes to the
bottom, and compels the muskrats to seek the
bushy banks, or to take shelter under the corn-shacks
or hay-stacks in the fields. Poor things,
they of all animals endure hardship; for one can
often track them to where they have scratched
away the snow while searching for grass-blades,
roots, acorns or apples that have fallen and decayed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span></p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span></p>

<h3>January Thirteenth</h3>

<p>When the wind sweeps over the fields and the
cold nips your ears, you are apt to come suddenly
upon a flock of snowflakes, or snow buntings.
Hastening back and forth among the weeds along
the bank, they reach up and pick the seeds and
crack them in their strong bills. They, too, like
the horned larks, have come from the North, and
in March will return again.</p>


<h3>January Fourteenth</h3>

<p>You cannot show your friendship for our native
birds in any better way than by being an enemy
of the English sparrow. He is a quarrelsome little
pest and seems to be getting more pugnacious every
year. He not only fights the other birds, but he
has been seen to throw their eggs to the ground and
to tear their nests to pieces. Be careful that he
does not steal the lunches that you have provided
for other birds.</p>


<h3>January Fifteenth</h3>

<p>How do the insects pass the winter? Much in
the same way that our plants and flowers do. As
the cold weather kills or withers the plants, leaving
their seeds and roots to send forth shoots next
summer, so most of the insects die, leaving their
eggs, their larvæ, and their pupa to be nourished
into life by the warm days of spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span></p>

<h3>January Sixteenth</h3>

<p>Insects are more dependent on climatic conditions
than are birds or mammals. Nevertheless, even on
the coldest days of winter, one may tear away the
bark of a forest tree and find spiders which show
signs of life, and if kept in a warm room for a few
hours, they become quite active.</p>


<h3>January Seventeenth</h3>

<p>The life of an insect which undergoes what is
termed a "complete transformation," is divided
into four stages: First, the egg; second, the larva;
third, the pupa or chrysalis, and fourth, the adult
insect or imago. Each of these changes is so complete
and different from any of the others, that the
insect never appears twice in an easily recognized
form.</p>


<h3>January Eighteenth</h3>

<p>Let us take the common house-fly for an example,
and follow it through the changes that it
must undergo before becoming adult. The mother
fly deposits more than a hundred eggs at a time,
in a dump at the back of the stable. The eggs
hatch in half a day.</p>

<h3>January Nineteenth</h3>

<p>Now we have the larvæ (maggots), as the second
stage is called. These little creatures are white and
grow very fast, shedding their skin several times
before they take on a different form, which they do
at the end of three or four days.</p>

<h3>January Twentieth</h3>

<p>The third, or pupa, stage is reached when a tiny
brown capsule-like formation has taken the place
of the maggot. In this stage no movement is
apparent, nor is any food taken; there is only a
quiet waiting for the final change, which comes in
about five days, when, out from one end of a
chrysalis, a fully developed fly appears.</p>


<h3>January Twenty-first</h3>

<p>The wonderful changes just described take place
throughout most of the insect world. The larvæ
of butterflies and moths are caterpillars; the larvæ
of June bugs or May beetles are grubs. Some moth
and butterfly caterpillars weave silken cocoons
about themselves; some make cocoons from leaves
or tiny chips of wood; some utilize the hair from
their own bodies, while others attach themselves to
the under side of boards, stones, and stumps, where,
after shedding their skin, they hang like mummies
until spring calls them back to life.</p>

<h3>January Twenty-second</h3>

<p>Bird lovers often make the mistake of putting
out nesting-boxes too late in the season. They
forget that most of the birds begin to look for
nesting-sites as soon as they arrive in the spring,
therefore the boxes should be in place before the
prospective tenants appear. March first is none
too early for many localities.</p>


<h3>January Twenty-third</h3>

<p>A natural cavity in a root, cut from a rustic
stump, or a short length of hollow limb, with a
two-inch augur hole bored near the top, and a
piece of board nailed over each end, makes an
artistic nesting-place for birds. Some persons prefer
a miniature cottage with compartments and
doors; though birds will often nest in them, the
simpler and more natural the home, the more
suited it is to their wants.</p>


<h3>January Twenty-fourth</h3>

<p>A few minutes' work with hammer, saw, and
knife, will convert any small wooden box that is
nailed (not glued) together, into a respectable
nesting-box. After it has been covered with two
coats of dark green paint it is ready to be put in
place. A shelf placed in a cornice, under a porch,
or the eaves of a building, makes an excellent resting-place
for the nest of a robin or a ph&#339;be.</p>

<h3>January Twenty-fifth</h3>

<p>Nesting-boxes may be placed almost anywhere
that there is shade and shelter. They ought to be
put beyond the reach of prowling cats and meddlesome
children, at least fifteen feet from the ground,
and to reap the benefit of your labor, they should
be near your sitting-room window.</p>


<h3>January Twenty-sixth</h3>

<p>It is better not to put an old nest or any nesting
material in the houses. Birds prefer to do their
own nest building, and they have their notions about
house furnishing, which do not agree with our ideas.
Birds have often refused nesting-boxes simply because
over-zealous persons had stuffed them with
hay or excelsior.</p>


<h3>January Twenty-seventh</h3>

<p>The birds that nest in bird-houses are the ones
which, if unprovided with them, would naturally
choose cavities in stumps, tree trunks, hollow limbs
and the like. Almost without exception this class
of nest-builders will return to the same nest year
after year, so once a pair has taken up its abode
with you, you may expect to see the birds for several
summers.</p>

<h3>January Twenty-eighth</h3>

<p>The following are common tenants of bird-houses:
Purple martin, bluebird, house wren,
chickadee, tufted titmouse, white-breasted nuthatch,
and tree or white-breasted swallow. These
birds are great insect destroyers, and most of them
are sweet songsters, so they should be encouraged
to take up their abode about our grounds.</p>


<h3>January Twenty-ninth</h3>

<p>After a deep fall of snow, the Northern shrike, or
butcher-bird, is forced into the villages and towns
for his food. Dashing into a flock of English sparrows,
he snatches one and carries it back to the
country to be eaten at his leisure. He is the bird
that impales small birds, mice, and large insects
on barbed-wire fences, or thorn bushes, after his
stomach has been filled, and hence his name.</p>


<h3>January Thirtieth</h3>

<p>Next to the beaver, the porcupine is the largest
rodent in the United States; the largest porcupines
live in Alaska. When on the ground, his short,
thick tail drags in the snow, leaving a zigzag trail.
When the snow is deep and the weather stormy, he
spends much of his time in pine, spruce, and hemlock
trees, feeding on the bark and twigs.</p>

<h3>January Thirty-first</h3>

<p>Hawks, before eating, tear away the skin and
feathers from their prey; but owls eat everything,
unless the prey be large, even bolting small birds
and mammals entire. In the course of a few hours
they disgorge pellets of indigestible portions, the
bones being encased in the feathers or hair. The
pellets may be found on the snow beneath the owl's
roost, and they often contain skulls of mice as white
and perfect as though they had been cleaned in a
museum.</p>

<h2><a name="February" id="February"><span class="antiqua">February</span></a></h2>


<h3>February First</h3>

<p>Mourning-cloak butterflies do not all die when
winter comes. Those that hibernate are usually
found singly or in clusters, hanging from the rafters
in old buildings, or from the under side of stones,
rails, limbs of trees, or boards. Those that appear
in the spring with tattered wings, have probably been
confined in buildings, and in their efforts to escape
have battered themselves against the windows.</p>


<h3>February Second</h3>

<p>Does any one know how old the story is that tells
us this is the day on which the bear and the woodchuck
rub their sleepy eyes and leave their winter
quarters for the first time? If they see their shadow
they return and sleep six weeks longer, but should
the day be cloudy, they are supposed to remain
active the rest of the season. This of course is only
a myth.</p>


<h3>February Third</h3>

<p>Frogs usually pass the winter in the mud at the
bottom of a stream, lake, or pond, or below frost-line
in a woodchuck, rabbit, or chipmunk burrow.
However, it is not uncommon to find them active
all winter in a spring, or a roadside drinking-trough
supplied from a spring. I wonder if they know that
spring-water seldom freezes, and that by choosing
such a place, they will not have to hibernate.</p>

<h3>February Fourth</h3>

<p>The bloodthirsty weasel, which is reddish brown
in summer (save the tip of his tail, which is always
black), is now colored to match his surroundings,
white. His tracks may be found in the woods and
along the stump fences in the fields, where he has
been searching for mice. He is one of the very few
mammals that will shed blood simply for the
pleasure of killing.</p>


<h3>February Fifth</h3>

<p>Students of nature will find it much easier to
identify birds if they take this opportunity before
the migrating birds arrive, to study carefully the
haunts of the common species. Many birds, you
know, are not found beyond the bounds of a certain
character of country chosen for them by nature.
So should you see in the deep woods a bird that you
at first take to be a Baltimore oriole or a bobolink,
a second thought will cause you to remember that
these birds are not found in the woods, consequently
you must be wrong.</p>


<h3>February Sixth</h3>

<p>The meadow lark, horned lark, bobolink, grasshopper
sparrow, vesper sparrow, and savannah
sparrow, are all common birds of the fields and
meadows, and they are seldom seen in the dense
woods or in the villages.</p>

<h3>February Seventh</h3>

<p>Among the birds that one may expect to see in
the woods and groves are the great-horned owl,
hermit thrush, wood thrush, blue-headed vireo,
golden-crowned thrush, scarlet tanager, black-throated
green warbler, and the black-throated blue
warbler.</p>


<h3>February Eighth</h3>

<p>The swamp birds, and birds found along the
banks of lakes, rivers, and streams, and seldom seen
far from them, are the belted kingfisher, red-shouldered
blackbird, spotted and solitary sandpipers,
great blue, night, and little green herons,
and the osprey, or fish-hawk.</p>


<h3>February Ninth</h3>

<p>Cleared woodlands overgrown with thick bushes,
shrubs, and vines, as well as the bushy thickets by
the waysides, are the favorite nesting-places for
another class of birds. In this category the common
varieties are the yellow-breasted chat, yellow warbler,
chestnut-sided warbler, Maryland yellow-throat,
catbird, brown thrasher, mocking-bird,
indigo bunting, and the black-billed and yellow-billed
cuckoos.</p>

<h3>February Tenth</h3>

<p>The swimming birds spend the greater part of
their time in the water. Most of them nest in the
lake regions of Canada. They are the ducks, geese,
and swans, of which there are nearly fifty species;
the grebes and loons, eleven species; the gulls and
terns, thirty-seven species; and the cormorants and
pelicans, beside many other water birds that we
seldom or never see in Eastern United States.</p>


<h3>February Eleventh</h3>

<p>Then, of course, there is a miscellaneous lot that
nest in the woods, orchards, village shade trees, or
any place where large trees are found. The flicker,
downy and hairy woodpeckers, screech owl, white-breasted
nuthatch, chickadee, robin, red-eyed vireo,
warbling vireo, and the yellow-throated vireo, comprise
some of the birds in this group.</p>


<h3>February Twelfth</h3>

<p>About spring-holes the snow melts quickly and
the grass remains green all winter. It is here that
you will find the runways of meadow mice, or voles
(not moles). They live on the roots and tender
blades of grass, but at this time of the year hunger
often compels them to eat the bark from fruit trees,
vines, and berry bushes, and during severe winters
they do great damage to apple trees.</p>

<h3>February Thirteenth</h3>

<p>The whistle-wing duck, or American golden eye,
attracts your attention by the peculiar whistling
sound that it makes with its wings while flying.
As it gets its food (small fish, and mussels), by
diving, it is able to remain in the Northern States all
winter and feed in the swift-running streams, in
air-holes, or other open water.</p>


<h3>February Fourteenth</h3>

<p>The skunk is one of the mammals who can hibernate
or not, just as he chooses. During prolonged
periods of cold, he takes shelter in a woodchuck's
burrow, and "cuddling down," goes to sleep but a
few inches from the rightful owner, who, in turn,
is also sleeping in a chamber back of the thin partition
of earth which he threw out in front of himself
when he retired in the fall.</p>


<h3>February Fifteenth</h3>

<p>The first bird to actually voice the approach
of spring, is the jolly little chickadee. His spring
song, "<i>spring's-com-ing</i>," sounds more like
"<i>ph&#339;be</i>" than does the note of the ph&#339;be itself,
for which it is often mistaken. It is a clear, plaintive
whistle, easily imitated, and when answered, the
songster can often be called within a few feet of one,
where he will perch and repeat his song as long as
he receives a reply.</p>

<h3>February Sixteenth</h3>

<p>Even the coldest weather does not close the swift-running
streams, which gives the muskrats a chance
to exercise their legs. It makes you shudder to see
one swim along the edge of the ice, then dive, and
come to the surface with a mouthful of food. Climbing
upon the ice, he eats it, then silently slips into
the water again. His hair is so well oiled, that an
ordinary wetting does not penetrate to the skin.</p>


<h3>February Seventeenth</h3>

<p>A crow's track can always be told from the tracks
of other birds of similar size, because there is a dash
in the snow made by the claw of his middle toe.
Again, his toes are long and set rather closely together,
and he seldom walks in a straight line, but
wanders about as though looking for something,
which is usually the case.</p>


<h3>February Eighteenth</h3>

<p>Many persons believe that a porcupine has the
power to throw his quills, but it is not so. When
alarmed, he hurries, in a lumbering sort of way, for
shelter. If you close in on him, he stops at once,
ducks his head, humps his back, raises his quill
armor, and awaits your attack. Approach closely,
and he turns his back and tail toward you, and the
instant you touch him he strikes with his club-like
tail, also armed with quills, leaving souvenirs sticking
into whatever they come in contact with.</p>

<h3>February Nineteenth</h3>

<p>As the migrating birds are beginning to arrive in
the Southern States, and will soon be North, let us
consider the subject of migration. The reason why
birds migrate North in the spring is not definitely-known.
Of course they leave the North because
cold and snow cut off their food supply; but why
in the spring do they abandon a country where food
is plentiful and make such long flights, apparently
for no other object than to bring forth their young
in the North?</p>


<h3>February Twentieth</h3>

<p>Is it not wonderful how birds find their way, over
thousands of miles of land and water, to the same
locality and often to the same nest, season after
season? How do we know that this is true? The
reappearance of a bird with a crippled foot or wing,
or one that has been tamed to feed from one's hand,
is unmistakable proof.</p>


<h3>February Twenty-first</h3>

<p>Ducks and geese make longest flights of any of
the migrating birds. They have been known to
cover three hundred miles without resting. The
smaller birds advance as the season advances, the
early arrivals being the ones that do not winter very
far south. Storm-waves often check their progress
and compel them to turn back a few hundred miles
and wait for the weather to moderate.</p>

<h3>February Twenty-second</h3>

<p>Most birds migrate at night; and a continued
warm rain followed by a clear warm night is sure to
bring a host of new arrivals. If you listen on moonlight
nights, you can often hear their chirps and
calls as they pass over. During foggy weather
many meet with accidents by getting lost and being
blown out to sea, or by flying against monuments,
buildings, or lighthouses.</p>


<h3>February Twenty-third</h3>

<p>Mr. Chapman tells us that, when migrating,
birds fly at a height of from one to three miles, and
that our Eastern birds leave the United States by
the way of the Florida peninsula. They are guided
in their flight by the coast-line and the river valleys.</p>


<h3>February Twenty-fourth</h3>

<p>Some migrants fly in compact flocks of hundreds,
like the ducks, for example, while others, like the
swallows, spread out. Then, again, there are birds
that arrive in pairs or singly. With still others, the
male precedes his mate by a week or ten days. Not
infrequently a flock of birds containing several
different species will be seen. This is particularly
true of the blackbirds and grackles.</p>

<h3>February Twenty-fifth</h3>

<p>You will notice that the birds are usually in full
song when they arrive from the South. Save for a
few calls and scolding notes, most of them are silent
during the winter, but as spring approaches they
begin to find their voices and probably are as glad
to sing as we are to hear them.</p>


<h3>February Twenty-sixth</h3>

<p>The snow-shoe rabbit, or Northern varying hare,
changes its color twice a year. In winter it is snow
white, but at this season it is turning reddish-brown.
In the far Northwest these hares are so abundant
that they make deep trails through the snow, and
the Indians and white trappers and traders shoot
and snare large numbers of them for food.</p>


<h3>February Twenty-seventh</h3>

<p>It makes no difference to the "chickaree," or
red squirrel, how much snow falls or how cold it
gets. He has laid by a stock of provisions and he is
not dependent on the food the season furnishes.
He is as spry and happy during the coldest blizzard
as he is on a midsummer day, for he knows well
where the hollow limb or tree-trunk is that contains
his store of nuts or grain.</p>

<p>The Carolina wren is the largest member of the
wren family in the Eastern United States. It breeds
sparingly in Southern New York and New England,
but is common about Washington, D. C., where it
is a resident. It is found in the forests, thickets,
and undergrowth along streams and lakes. Mr.
Hoffman says that its song "is so loud and clear
that it can be heard easily a quarter of a mile."</p>

<h3>March First</h3>

<p>A lady once asked me how to destroy the "insect
eggs" on the under side of fern leaves. The ferns
are flowerless plants, and they produce spores
instead of seeds. Usually the spores are arranged
in dotted lines, on the underside of the leaves (or
fronds as they are called), and these are the "insect
eggs" the lady referred to.</p>


<h3>March Second</h3>

<p>Even at this early date the female great-horned
owl or hoot owl, in some sections of the country, is
searching for a place to build her nest. She usually
selects an abandoned hawk's or a crow's nest, and
after laying her four chalky-white eggs, she is often
compelled to sit on them most of the night to prevent
them from freezing.</p>


<h3>March Third</h3>

<p>A question that is often asked is, what do the
early migrating birds eat, when the ground is frozen
and insect life is still slumbering. If you knew
where to look, you would find many of the fruit-trees
and vines filled with dried, or frozen fruit.
Frozen apples and mountain-ash berries constitute
a large part of the robin's and the cedar-bird's food
early in the spring, and the bluebirds and cedar-birds
eat the shriveled barberry fruit.</p>

<h3>March Fourth</h3>

<p>In Florida, the black bear can get food throughout
the entire year, but in the North he is compelled
to hibernate during the winter. He is now beginning
to think of leaving his den (in a cave, crevice
of the rocks, or under the roots of a partially upturned
tree) to begin his summer vacation. We are
apt to think that bears are poor when they leave
the den, but this is not always true, although their
pelage does get very much worn from coming in
contact with protuberances in their winter quarters.</p>


<h3>March Fifth</h3>

<p>The first plant to thrust its head above ground
and proclaim the coming of spring is the skunk
cabbage, or swamp cabbage. Even before the
snow has entirely left, the plant will melt a hole and
by its own warmth keep itself from freezing. In
many localities at this date the leathery hoods are
several inches above the ground.</p>


<h3>March Sixth</h3>

<p>In America the cowbird, like the European
cuckoo, lays its eggs in the nests of other birds. All
of our American cuckoos build their nests and
raise their young in a manner creditable to parents.</p>

<p>Clinging to the cliffs and rocks in the forests, the
dark green leathery leaves of the polypody fern are
nearly as fresh and green as when first snowed
under. Hunt among the clusters until you find a
fertile frond, then examine the back of it and see
how closely together the spores are placed.</p>


<h3>March Eighth</h3>

<p>We will awaken some morning to find that during
the night the song sparrows have arrived from the
South; not all of them, to be sure, but just a few
that are anxious to push North and begin nesting.
All winter their merry song has been hushed, but
now it gushes forth, not to stop again until the
molting season in August.</p>



<h3>March Ninth</h3>

<p>A porcupine should never be called a hedgehog.
The hedgehog, an insectivorous animal, inhabiting
Europe, is not found in the Western Hemisphere.
It rolls itself into a ball when attacked, and the
spines, which <i>do not come out</i>, are shorter, duller,
and less formidable than those of the porcupine.</p>

<h3>March Tenth</h3>

<p>People, knowing that the robin is an early spring
arrival, are always alert to see or hear the first one.
Consequently the first song that catches their ear
is supposed to be that of a robin, whereas often it
is the spring song of the white-breasted nuthatch,
which really has no resemblance to the robin's
song.</p>


<h3>March Eleventh</h3>

<p>When you see a bird with a crest (not one that
simply raises its head feathers) it must be one of the
following species: A blue jay, tufted titmouse,
pileated woodpecker, cardinal grosbeak, (also
called redbird and cardinal), Bohemian waxwing,
or a cedar-bird. These are the only birds inhabiting
the Eastern States that wear true crests. The
belted kingfisher and many of the ducks and herons
have ruffs and plumes but these can scarcely be
considered crests.</p>


<h3>March Twelfth</h3>

<p>Some scientists contend that, owing to their
intelligence, ants should rank next to man and
before the anthropoid apes. They have soldiers
that raid other ant colonies and capture eggs, and
when the eggs hatch, the young are kept as slaves;
they have nurses that watch and care for the eggs
and helpless larvæ, and cows (<i>Aphids</i>) that are
tended with almost human intelligence.</p>

<h3>March Thirteenth</h3>

<p>The Audubon Society has stopped the slaughter
of grebes. Before the enactment of the laws framed
by the society, these duck-like birds were killed for
their snow-white breasts, which were used for decorating
(?) women's hats. Grebes are now migrating
to the lakes of the North, where they build floating
nests of reeds.</p>


<h3>March Fourteenth</h3>

<p>The only sure way to tell a venomous snake is to
kill the reptile, open its mouth with a stick, and look
for the hollow, curved fangs. When not in use they
are compressed against the roof of the mouth,
beneath the reptile's eyes. They are hinged, as you
can see if you pull them forward with a pencil.
The venom is contained in a sack hidden beneath
the skin at the base of each fang.</p>


<h3>March Fifteenth</h3>

<p>As a mimic and a persistent songster, the mocking-bird
has no rival, but when quality is considered,
I think we have several songsters that are its equal.
The bobolink and the winter wren both have
rollicking songs that are inspiring and wonderful,
but to my ear there are no songs that equal those
of the hermit thrush and the wood thrush. Still,
the selection of a bird vocalist is a matter of choice
which is often influenced by one's association with
the singer.</p>

<h3>March Sixteenth</h3>

<p>If you will look into one of the large cone-shaped
paper nests of the bald-faced hornet, which hang
to the limbs of the trees or under the eaves of the
house, you will be almost certain to find a few house
flies that have passed the winter between the folds
of paper. They now show signs of life, and are
ready to make their appearance during the first
warm spell.</p>


<h3>March Seventeenth</h3>

<p>Before the snow has left, you are likely to see
dirt-stained spots on the hillsides where the woodchuck
or ground-hog has thrown out the partition
of dirt which kept the winter air from his bed-chamber.
Of course he has not come out for good,
but on warm, sunny days he will make short excursions
from his burrow to see how the season is
progressing. In the early spring, before vegetation
sprouts, he finds it difficult to find good food in
plenty.</p>

<h3>March Eighteenth</h3>

<p>The herring gulls that have been about our
harbors and bays all winter, will not remain much
longer. They are about to leave for their nesting
grounds, in the marshes and on the islands of New
England and Canada. In the fall they will return
with their young, which wear a grayish plumage.</p>

<h3>March Nineteenth</h3>

<p>In winter meadow mice build neat little nests of
dried grass on the ground beneath the snow. They
are hollow balls, about the size of a hat crown, with
a small opening in one or two sides. The outside
is made of coarse, rank grass, while the lining is of
the finest material obtainable. The heat from the
little animals' bodies soon melts an air chamber
around the nest, into which lead many tunnels
through the snow. As soon as the snow has melted,
you will find these nests scattered about the fields
and meadows, but they are empty now.</p>


<h3>March Twentieth</h3>

<p>The fish crow is a small edition of the common
crow. He is a resident of the Atlantic and Gulf
coasts from South Carolina to Louisiana. His note
resembles the "caw" of the Northern crow, minus
the <i>w</i>, being more of a croak: "<i>cak, cak, cak, cak</i>."
You will find him on the coast and along the rivers.</p>


<h3>March Twenty-first</h3>

<p>The white-tailed deer of the deep forests have
dropped their antlers by this time, and a new set
has started to grow. (Elk, moose, caribou, and
deer have antlers; sheep, goats and cattle have
horns, and retain them throughout life.) Antlers
are cast off annually, and a new set will grow in
about seven months.</p>

<h3>March Twenty-second</h3>

<p>The purple grackle, or crow blackbird, should
make his appearance in Southern New York about
this time. He is the large, handsome fellow who
lives in colonies and builds his nest in pine, hemlock,
and spruce groves near human habitations.
As soon as his young are hatched, he frequents the
banks of rivers and lakes and walks along in quest
of insects. He is one of the few birds that <i>walks</i>.</p>


<h3>March Twenty-third</h3>

<p>Screech owls are now nesting in natural cavities
in apple-trees, but they should not be disturbed,
for they feed on mice, beetles and other harmful
animals. Owls are very interesting birds, but their
wisdom is only in their looks. Their eyes are
stationary, so in order to look sidewise, they must
turn their head. Watch one and notice him dilate
and contract the pupil of his eyes, according to
the light, and the distance of the object at which
he is gazing.</p>


<h3>March Twenty-fourth</h3>

<p>The American goldfinch, thistlebird, or wild
canary, often spends the winter with us, but in his
grayish-brown suit he is not recognized by his
friends who only know him in his summer garb of
black and yellow. The male and the female look
alike now, but soon the male will don gorgeous
colors and wear them until after the nesting season.</p>

<h3>March Twenty-fifth</h3>

<p>The scarlet heads of the velvet, or stag-horn
sumach are very conspicuous on the rocky hillsides
and gravelly bottoms. The fruit of the poison
sumach hangs more like a bunch of grapes, while
the stag-horn fruit is in a massive cluster. Persons
susceptible to poisonous plants should never
approach any poisonous shrub, particularly when
the body is overheated.</p>


<h3>March Twenty-sixth</h3>

<p>From the swamps and river-banks comes the
clatter of loud blackbird voices. Flocks containing
hundreds of these noisy fellows perch in the tops
of the trees, resting after their long migration flight.
From the babble, you recognize the "<i>konk-a-ree</i>"
of the red-shouldered blackbird, the harsh squeaky
notes of the rusty grackle, and the purple grackle.
As you approach, the flock takes flight, and you
discover that all of the red-wing blackbirds are
males; the females have not yet arrived.</p>


<h3>March Twenty-seventh</h3>

<p>In the dead of winter you may sometimes see a
belted kingfisher along some swift-running stream,
but as a rule, north of Virginia, few stay with us
throughout the year. Most of them appear about
this time, and you see them perched on some low
limb overhanging a pond or a stream.</p>

<h3>March Twenty-eighth</h3>

<p>From bogs, shaded woods, and sheltered highways.
Nature's question-marks, the "fiddle-heads,"
appear above the loam. They are baby ferns,
preparing to expand and wave their graceful leaves
in the face of all beholders. These queer, woolly
sprouts the Indians use for food, and birds also
eat them.</p>


<h3>March Twenty-ninth</h3>

<p>The clear, sweet, and plaintive whistle "<i>pee-a-peabody, peabody, peabody</i>,"
(which to the French
Canadian is interpreted "<i>la-belle-Canada, Canada, Canada</i>")
of the white-throated sparrow, or
Canada bird, is a common, early spring song, now
heard in the swamps and thickets. This sparrow
may be found about New York City all winter, but
it passes North to nest.</p>


<h3>March Thirtieth</h3>

<p>Beneath hickory-nut. Walnut, and butternut
trees, you are sure to find large numbers of nut-shells
that have been rifled of their contents by red
squirrels, chipmunks, meadow mice, and white-footed
mice. In nearly every instance, the intelligent
little rodents have gnawed through the flat
sides of the shell, directly into the meat, and taken
it out as "clean as a whistle." But who "<i>taught</i>
them" to select the <i>flat</i> side?</p>

<h3>March Thirty-first</h3>

<p>The noisy kildeer is rare in Pennsylvania and
New York, but it is a common plover in Ohio.
Its note, "<i>kildeer, kildeer, kildeer</i>," is emitted while
the bird is on the ground or in the air. This plover
is very abundant in the far West, and when a
hunter is stalking antelope, it often flies about his
head, calling loudly and warning the game of
danger. For this trait it is sometimes called "tell-tale
plover."</p>

<h3>April First</h3>

<p>A question which puzzles scientists, is how the
turtles and frogs (which have lungs) are able, at
the close of summer, to bury themselves in the mud
at the bottom of a river or pond and remain there
until the following spring. The frogs appear a few
days before the turtles are seen.</p>


<h3>April Second</h3>

<p>The meadowlark's song, "<i>spring-o-the-year</i>," is
heard at its best in this month and in May; but the
note is one of the few that may be frequently heard
in southern New England, during the entire winter.
As its name implies, the meadowlark is a bird of the
fields and meadows only, but it will often alight in
the top of a tall tree and send forth its joyful song.
Watch and listen for it now.</p>


<h3>April Third</h3>

<p>As soon as spring arrives and the ice has left the
streams, hordes of May or shad fly nymphs can be
found working their way against the current a few
inches from the shore. Catch a few of them and
put them in a tumbler of water and watch their
external or "trachea" gills working. The adult
insects are abundant in summer, but at this time
of the year (even earlier), the stone flies which
flit over the melting snow are often mistaken for
May, or shad flies.</p>

<h3>April Fourth</h3>

<p>The name "purple finch" is very misleading, for
the head, neck, breast, and throat of the bird are
more crimson than purple. The female is often
mistaken for a sparrow, as her color is dull, and
her breast streaked. This finch often takes up its
abode in the coniferous trees in the villages. "Its
song bursts forth as if from some uncontrollable
stress of gladness, and is repeated uninterruptedly
over and over again." (Bicknell.)</p>


<h3>April Fifth</h3>

<p>If the season is not belated, you may expect to
find the blood-root peeping through the rocky soil,
on exposed brushy hillsides, or along the margins of
the woods. You must look for it early, for its petals
drop soon after the flower blossoms. The Indians
used the blood-red juice which flows when the root
is broken, to decorate their bodies.</p>


<h3>April Sixth</h3>

<p>The brush lots, roadways, and open forests in
the Northern States, are now filled with juncoes on
the way to their nesting grounds in Canada and
the mountainous portions of this country. They
are with us but a few weeks and will not be seen
again until next fall. The pinkish bill and the
two white outer tail-feathers are of great assistance
in identifying this bird, for they are very conspicuous
when it flies.</p>

<h3>April Seventh</h3>

<p>While walking along the bank of a stream you
are quite apt to surprise a pair of pickerel lying
side by side in shallow water. Save for the vibration
of their fins, and the movement of their gills, they
do not stir. As you approach they dart off, and
you see a roily spot, where they have taken shelter
among the aquatic plants.</p>


<h3>April Eighth</h3>

<p>The birds having white tail-feathers, or tail-feathers
that are tipped with white, which show
conspicuously when the owners are on the wing, are
the meadowlark, vesper sparrow, chewink, snowflake,
junco, blue jay, white-breasted nuthatch,
Northern shrike, kingbird, hairy woodpecker,
downy woodpecker, nighthawk, and whip-poor-will.</p>


<h3>April Ninth</h3>

<p>The clustering liverwort, hepatica, or squirrel
cup, with its fuzzy stems and pretty flowers of
various shades of blue, grow side by side with the
white wood anemone, or wind-flower. As soon as
the wood anemone blossoms, a slight breeze causes
the petals to fall; that is why it is called "wind-flower."</p>

<h3>April Tenth</h3>

<p>One of the birds that sportsmen have protected
by prohibiting spring shooting, is Wilson's snipe,
or jacksnipe. Like many of the early migrants it
does not nest in the United States; consequently it
is only seen in the spring and fall. It is a bird of
the marsh and bog, seldom seen except by those
who know where and how to find it.</p>


<h3>April Eleventh</h3>

<p>The gall-flies, or gall-gnats, cut tiny incisions in
the oak leaves and golden-rod stems, and lay their
eggs between the tissues. These wounds produce
large swellings which furnish the larval insects with
food. If broken into at this season, one discovers
that the galls on the golden-rod stems are pithy.
Embedded in the pith is a white "worm," or a
small black capsule, but if the "gall" is empty, a
hole will be found where the fly emerged.</p>


<h3>April Twelfth</h3>

<p>The red-shouldered hawk is one of our common
birds of prey. Its loud, somewhat cat-like cry,
coming from the dense hardwood forests which
border swamps, lakes, and rivers, at once attracts
attention. A pair has been known to return to the
same nesting locality for fifteen consecutive years.
This hawk has proved itself to be of inestimable
value to the farmer, and deserves his protection.</p>

<h3>April Thirteenth</h3>

<p>For the past six weeks, chipmunks have occasionally
come out from their nests of dried grass
and leaves, made in one of their several tunnels beneath
the line of frost under a stone pile, or a
stump. Now they are seen every day. It is only
of recent years that we have discovered that chipmunks
destroy grubs and insects, thus rendering
service for the nuts and grain that they carry away
in the fall.</p>


<h3>April Fourteenth</h3>

<p>Have you noticed how the robins congregate in
the evening and battle with each other on the house-tops
until dark? It is during the mating season
that these fights take place. Long after the other
birds have gone to bed. Cock Robin is awake, and
shouting loud and defiant challenges to whoever
will accept them.</p>


<h3>April Fifteenth</h3>

<p>Fungi are the lowest forms of plant life. They
subsist on living and dead organic matter, and not
from the soil, as do most other plants. The bread
molds, downy mildew on decaying fruit and vegetables,
and the fungus that kills fish and insects, are
all forms of fungi. Patches of luxuriant grass are
seen where decaying fungi have fertilized the soil.</p>

<h3>April Sixteenth</h3>

<p>The continuous "<i>chip-chip-chip-chip-chip-chip&mdash;&mdash;</i>"
of the chipping sparrow, like a toy insect
that must run down before it can stop, is always a
welcome sound at this time of the year. He can
easily be tamed to take food from one's hand.
Although a neat nest-builder, "chippy" selects
poor nesting sites, and often the wind upsets his
hair-lined cup and destroys the eggs or young.</p>


<h3>April Seventeenth</h3>

<p>At first the song of the spring peeper, which is
really a <i>frog</i>, is heard only in the evening, but as the
days get warmer, a perfect chorus of piping voices
comes from swamps and stagnant pools. He
strongly objects to singing before an audience, but
it is well worth one's while to wait patiently and
catch him in the act of inflating the skin beneath his
chin.</p>


<h3>April Eighteenth</h3>

<p>On account of its tufted head, and clear, ringing
song, "<i>peto, peto, peto, peto</i>" or "<i>de, de, de, de</i>,"
much like a chickadee (Chapman) the tufted
titmouse is a well-known bird throughout its range:
eastern United States, from northern New Jersey,
and southern Iowa to the plains.</p>

<h3>April Nineteenth</h3>

<p>Where is the country boy or girl who does not
know the "woolly bear," or "porcupine caterpillar,"
the chunky, hairy, rufous and black-banded
caterpillar, that curls up when touched and does
not uncoil until danger is over? They are the larvæ
of the Isabella moth, and the reason for their
appearance on the railroad tracks and wagon roads,
is that they have just finished hibernating and are
now looking for a suitable place to retire and change
to chrysalides and then into moths.</p>


<h3>April Twentieth</h3>

<p>In the Northern States, where the red-headed
woodpecker is not very common, it is apt to be
confused with other species of woodpeckers. The
red-headed woodpecker is <i>scarlet down to its shoulders</i>.
The eastern woodpeckers that have the red
crescent on the back of the head are flicker, downy,
and hairy woodpeckers.</p>


<h3>April Twenty-first</h3>

<p>The gardener, while spading about the roots of a
tree, will often throw out a number of white, chunky
grubs, about the size of the first joint of one's little
finger. These are the larvæ of the June, or May
beetle. In the fall, they dig below frost line, where
they remain until the following spring. After
three years of this life, they emerge from the ground
in May and June, perfect beetles.</p>

<h3>April Twenty-second</h3>

<p>The myrtle, or yellow-rumped warbler, which
spends the winter from Massachusetts, south, into
the West Indies and Central America, and nests
usually north of the United States, is very common
now. It is found in scattered flocks. If in doubt
of its identity, look for the yellow patch on the
crown, and on the rump.</p>


<h3>April Twenty-third</h3>

<p>The dainty little spring beauty, or claytonia, is
another of the early blooming flowers. "We look
for the spring beauty in April or May, and often
find it in the same moist places&mdash;on a brook's
edge or skirting of wet woods&mdash;as the yellow
adder's tongue." (Dana.)</p>


<h3>April Twenty-fourth</h3>

<p>Toads are now beginning to leave their winter
beds, in the leaves, under stones and the like. Did
you ever tie a piece of red cloth on a string, dangle
it over a toad's head, to see him follow and snap at
it? Toads exude a strong acid secretion from the
pores of the skin, which is distasteful to most
predatory animals, excepting the snakes.</p>

<h3>April Twenty-fifth</h3>

<p>The yellow-bellied sapsucker is the only member
of the woodpecker family whose presence is objectionable.
His habit of puncturing the bark of
trees and then visiting the cups to catch the sap, is
well known. At any time of the year, row after
row of these holes may be seen on fruit-trees (usually
apple and pear)&mdash;written evidence of his guilt.
See if you can catch him in the act.</p>


<h3>April Twenty-sixth</h3>

<p>Turkey buzzards, or vultures, are repulsive and
ungainly when on the ground, but they are by far
the most graceful of all our large birds when in
flight. They are rarely seen in New England, or
in the Northern States of the Middle Atlantic group,
but in the South they are common throughout the
year. Mounting high in the air, they circle 'round
and 'round with scarcely a flutter of the wings, but
nervously tilting to right or left, like a tight-rope
walker with his balancing pole.</p>


<h3>April Twenty-seventh</h3>

<p>This is about the time that young red foxes get
their first sight of the wide, wide world. In the
Southern States they have been prowling about
with their parents for weeks; but north of New
York City the farmer's boy, as he now goes for the
cows in the morning, will frequently see a fox family
playing about the entrance to their burrow.</p>

<h3>April Twenty-eighth</h3>

<p>So ruthlessly has the trailing arbutus, or "May-flower"
as it is called in New England, been destroyed,
that in places where it was once common,
it is now almost extinct. Of its odor, Neltje Blanchan
says: "Can words describe the fragrancy of
the very breath of spring&mdash;that delicious commingling
of the perfumes of arbutus, the odors of pines,
and the snow-soaked soil just warming into life?"</p>


<h3>April Twenty-ninth</h3>

<p>Why are the robins so abundant? Because they
are all pushing forward to their Northern nesting
grounds. Even in Alaska you would find a few
pairs that have made the long, perilous journey in
safety, raising their young in the balsam-poplars
along some glacial stream, while in Georgia and
Florida, where large flocks of them winter, not one
would now be seen.</p>


<h3>April Thirtieth</h3>

<p>If you will sow a few sunflower seeds in a corner
of the garden and let the plants go to seed, in the
fall you are sure to have feathered visitors in the
shape of goldfinches, chickadees, and nuthatches.
The nuthatches (no doubt thinking of the hard
times to come) will carry the seeds away, and store
them in the crevices of the bark of trees.</p>

<h3>May First</h3>

<p>Of uniform grayish color, swift in flight, and
shaped like cigars with wings, the chimney swifts
might well be called the torpedo boats of the air.
They never alight outside of chimneys or old buildings,
and are usually seen flying high above the
house-tops. For hours they chase each other
through the air, keeping up a continuous "<i>chip,
chip, chip, chip, chip, chip</i>," whenever the participants
of the game come near each other.</p>


<h3>May Second</h3>

<p>No sooner does the frost leave the ground, than
the moles begin to work close to the surface, making
ridges where the earth is soft, and throwing out
small mounds, when it is packed firm. The star-nose
mole inhabits damp soil, while the common
mole likes the dry highlands. Although moles'
eyes are small, he who thinks that they cannot see,
should hold his finger before one's nose and see
how quickly it will be bitten.</p>


<h3>May Third</h3>

<p>The marsh marigold, which grows in thick
clusters in the swamps and along the streams, is
now in full bloom. These flowers are often sold on
the streets for "cowslips," a name wholly incorrect.
The leaves make fine greens.</p>

<h3>May Fourth</h3>

<p>By this time one of your bird houses should be
tenanted by a pair of house wrens. They migrate
at night and the male arrives about a week in
advance of his mate. Both birds assist in building
the nest and in raising the young. As soon as the
first brood has been reared, the lining of the nest is
removed, and a new one built before the second set
of six eggs is laid. Wrens may easily be tamed
to take spiders and caterpillars (not the hairy ones)
from the end of a stick and even from one's hand.</p>


<h3>May Fifth</h3>

<p>How much easier would be the work of nest
building if we provided the birds with nesting
material. Scatter strips of cloth, and pieces of
coarse twine on the ground for the robins; hair
from the tail and mane of horses for the chipping
sparrows and wrens; twine and horse-hair for the
orioles; bits of "waste" for the yellow warblers,
and grapevine bark for the catbirds. None of
these strands should be more than four inches long.</p>

<h3>May Sixth</h3>

<p>In some localities the shad-tree is now in full
blossom. As you pause to cut off a few twigs,
your ears are greeted by a never ceasing chorus of
toad music. This is the toad's "love song"&mdash;a
high-pitched, somewhat tremulous, and rather
monotonous note.</p>

<h3>May Seventh</h3>

<p>Perched upon a stump, fence post, or low limb
of a tree, the Bob-white sends forth his clear, far-reaching
whistle "<i>Bob-white</i>." In the North this
bird is known to every boy as Bob-white, or quail,
while in the South he is called "partridge." The
last two names are misnomers, for we have no
native quails or partridges in this country.</p>


<h3>May Eighth</h3>

<p>The fronds of the sensitive fern resemble somewhat
the leaves of the oak-tree, and in some localities
it is called the oak-leaf fern. It is found in
damp, shady spots, and is one of the common ferns
of New England. The delicate, light green leaves
wither soon after being picked, and it is the first of
the ferns to fall under the touch of Jack Frost.</p>


<h3>May Ninth</h3>

<p>A low, squeaking sound made with the lips is
understood by some birds as a signal of distress.
Orioles, wrens, catbirds, cuckoos, warblers, vireos,
robins, and many other birds may be called close
to one, particularly if the intruder is near their
nest. You should learn this trick, for often it is
possible to coax a shy bird from a thicket in order
that it may be identified.</p>

<h3>May Tenth</h3>

<p>In summer the most common of our Northern
wood warblers, yet one of the most difficult to see,
on account of its liking for the tops of the tall trees,
is the black-throated green warbler. Its song is a
cheerful, interrogative, "<i>Will you co-ome, will you
co-ome, will you?</i>" (Wright), or "a droning zee,
zee, ze-ee, zee." (Chapman and Reed.)</p>


<h3>May Eleventh</h3>

<p>Why is it that the usually frisky and noisy red
squirrels have become so quiet? If you could look
into the nest of dried grass and bark, in a hollow
tree-trunk, or a deserted woodpecker's nest, you
would understand their reason for not wishing to
make their presence known. Keep close watch of
the opening, and some day you will see several little
heads appear, and in a few days a family of squirrels
will be scrambling about the trees. Pretty and
graceful as these squirrels are, they do great damage
by destroying the eggs and young of birds.</p>


<h3>May Twelfth</h3>

<p>Wintering south of Central America, the veery,
or Wilson's thrush, should now appear in the
vicinity of Albany. "A weird rhythm" is the
expression sometimes used to describe the song of
this bird. Weird it certainly is, and beautiful, as
well, coming from the depths of some sombre wood,
growing more sombre still as the night falls.</p>

<h3>May Thirteenth</h3>

<p>The wood thrush is much larger than the veery,
and easily distinguished from the six other species
of true thrushes of North America, by the <i>large
black spots on the breast, and the bright cinnamon
head</i>. As you listened for the veery, you probably
heard the wood thrush's pure liquid song&mdash;so far
away that you could not catch the low after-notes.
To me, the flute-like quality of the wood thrush's
song makes it the most enchanting of all bird
music.</p>


<h3>May Fourteenth</h3>

<p>At intervals during the day, a distinct booming
sound is heard coming from the forests. At first
the beats are slow and measured, but as they are
repeated the time quickens, until they finally blend,
and then gradually die away. This is the "drumming"
of the ruffed grouse, produced by the cock
bird beating with his wings against the sides of his
body. At this time of the year it is his love song,
but you can hear it at other seasons as well.</p>


<h3>May Fifteenth</h3>

<p>Visit again the locality where a week ago you
heard so many toads, and what do you find? Long
strings of gelatine-covered specks strewn on the
bottom of the pond. These black spots are the
eggs of the toad, and the gelatine is put around
them to protect them and to furnish the first meal
for the young polywogs.</p>

<h3>May Sixteenth</h3>

<p>To find a hummingbird's nest, snugly saddled
on a branch of a maple or apple tree, ten feet or
more above the ground, requires patience and keen
eyesight. Unless you have seen one, you almost
surely would mistake it for a bunch of lichens.
It is a neat little structure of downy material
covered with bits of lichens, fastened with spider
and caterpillar webs.</p>

<h3>May Seventeenth</h3>

<p>It would interest you to visit a zoological park to
study the growing antlers of a deer or an elk. A
pair of black antlers, "in the velvet," as the hunters
call it, have taken the place of the bony-colored
ones shed in March. Just now they are somewhat
flexible, and feverishly hot from the steady flow of
blood that feeds them. If they are injured at this
time, the owner might bleed to death.</p>


<h3>May Eighteenth</h3>

<p>"<i>Caw, caw, caw, ka, ka, ka, ka-k-k-k-r-r-r-r</i>."
It sounds as though a crow were being strangled.
Looking in that direction you see a large black
bird fly from the woods to a meadow. After filling
her beak with food she returns. No sooner is she
within sight of the young crows, than they flap
their wings, open their mouths and <i>caw</i> until the
stifled, guttural sounds tell you that the morsel is
being swallowed.</p>

<h3>May Nineteenth</h3>

<p>When perched or flying the bobolink sends forth
his jolly song in such a flood of ecstasy that you
would scarcely be surprised to see him suddenly
explode and vanish in a cloud of feathers. Would
that we could overlook the damage he does to
Southern rice crops.</p>

<h3>May Twentieth</h3>

<p>Before now you have noticed the dainty little
Jack-in-the-pulpit in the damp, shady woods and
marshes. Would you suppose that this innocent
looking plant is really an insect trap? The thick
fleshy "corm" when boiled is quite palatable,
but who would think so after digging it from the
ground, cutting into it, and feeling the sharp
prickly sensation it gives when touched with the
tongue?</p>


<h3>May Twenty-first</h3>

<p>The song of the brown thrasher can easily be
mistaken for that of a catbird, particularly as both
birds inhabit roadways, thickets, and open brush
lots. The male, while singing to his mate, nearly
always perches <i>in the top</i> of a tall bush or tree. His
song is a disconnected combination of pleasant musical
tones, which might be arranged so as to sound
thrush-like in effect, but they are usually uttered in
pairs or trios, rather than in the modulated phrase
of the hermit or the wood thrush.</p>

<h3>May Twenty-second</h3>

<p>Look intently at the bottom of shallow streams
or ponds and you will see what appear to be small
twigs and sandy lumps moving about like snails.
These are the larvæ of the caddis fly. Pick up one
and poke the creature with a straw. You now
discover that it lives in a case made of gravel, or
sand, or tiny shells, or pieces of bark, all glued
together in a perfect mask.</p>


<h3>May Twenty-third</h3>

<p>Keep watch of any brown bird about the size
and shape of a female English sparrow, that you
see hopping about the trees and bushes, peeping
under bridges, and looking into hollow limbs of
trees. She is a cowbird, or cow bunting, looking
for the nest of another bird who is away for the
moment. When she finds one, she will slip into it
and drop one of her eggs, which will be hatched
and the birdling reared by the foster mother, unless
she can manage to get rid of it.</p>


<h3>May Twenty-fourth</h3>

<p>The Greeks were persistent in their belief that
the harmless red, or fire salamander, found only
in damp and shady places, was insensible to heat.
In reality the reverse is true. Its delicate skin
cannot even withstand the sun's rays. During
sunny days it hides under leaves and logs, coming
forth only after storms, or at night.</p>

<h3>May Twenty-fifth</h3>

<p>If there are currant or gooseberry bushes about
your grounds, you must know the yellow warbler,
or summer yellowbird. He is the little chap,
almost pure yellow, who hunts carefully under
each leaf for the caterpillars that attack the bushes.
The female lacks the reddish streaks on the under
parts, and her crown is not as bright as that of the
male. Do not confuse this bird with the male
American goldfinch, which just now has a yellow
body, but black crown, wings, and tail.</p>


<h3>May Twenty-sixth</h3>

<p>Quite unlike the strings of beady eggs of the
toad, the eggs of the frogs are attached in a bulky
mass to sticks or to the limbs of aquatic plants in
sluggish or stagnant water. But there is the same
gelatine-like casing around each black egg.</p>


<h3>May Twenty-seventh</h3>

<p>In the Northern States, where he nests, the redstart
is often seen in the shade-trees along our
streets, as well as in the groves and forests. "'<i>Ching,
ching, chee; ser-wee, swee, swee-e-s</i>' he sings, and
with wings and tail outspread whirls about, dancing
from limb to limb, darts upward, floats downward,
blows hither and thither like a leaf in the breeze."
(Chapman.)</p>

<h3>May Twenty-eighth</h3>

<p>In the evening you often see a chimney swift (it
is not a <i>swallow</i>) flying back and forth over dead
tree-tops. Each time it pauses as though about to
alight, but after what seems to be a momentary
hesitation, it passes on. With a field-glass you
might detect it snapping off the twigs and carrying
them into an unused chimney, where it fastens
them to the bricks with a glutinous saliva. One
after another the twigs are glued together until a
bracket-like basket is made, and in this the four
white eggs are laid.</p>


<h3>May Twenty-ninth</h3>

<p>It is now time to look in the meadows for the
dainty blue-eyed grass, or blue star; in the marshes
for the purple or water avens, and the white hellebore,
or Indian poke; and in the damp shady
woods for the blossoming mandrake, or Mayapple.</p>


<h3>May Thirtieth</h3>

<p>Judging from the name, one might expect to
find the pewee, or wood pewee, in the woods only,
but his high plaintive "<i>P-e-w-e-e, p-e-w-e-e</i>," first
rising, then falling, coming from the tops of the
village shade-trees, is one of the last notes heard
at the close of the day. Short as the song is, he
frequently sings but half of it.</p>

<h3>May Thirty-first</h3>

<p>Birds are often great sufferers from heat. The
open bill, drooping wings, and panting body, all
testify to this fact. A bird sitting on an unshaded
nest during a hot day is an object for our pity.
Fill flower-pot saucers with fresh water, and place
them in depressions about the grounds. The birds
will get great relief from these drinking and bathing
dishes, and your opportunity for observation will
be increased.</p>

<h2><a name="June" id="June"><span class="antiqua">June</span></a></h2>


<h3>June First</h3>

<p>One night last summer, a moth laid a circular
cluster of eggs at the end of a limb. Not many days
ago the eggs hatched and the caterpillars have
begun to spin a silk tent in the crotch of several
branches. Every time these tent caterpillars (for
that is their name) go out to feed upon the
leaves, they spin a thread by which they find their
way home. After they have eaten their fill, they
will drop to the ground to seek a hiding-place
and there turn into moths.</p>


<h3>June Second</h3>

<p>The fertile fronds of the cinnamon fern break
ground before the sterile ones come up. They
<i>appear</i> to shoot from the centre of the crown-shaped
cluster, and are light cinnamon color when mature.
By the last of June the fertile fronds have withered,
leaving only the sterile ones which the amateur is
quite sure to confuse with the interrupted fern.</p>


<h3>June Third</h3>

<p>While driving in the country your attention is
often drawn to the swallows that are flying about
the barns. Two species are common, one has <i>two
long tail feathers that fork</i>. This is the <i>barn
swallow</i>, and his mate builds her nest <i>inside</i> the
barn, <i>on a rafter</i> or <i>against the planking</i>. It is
always <i>open on top</i> and lined with soft material.</p>

<h3>June Fourth</h3>

<p>The eave swallow <i>lacks the forked tail</i>, and the
rump is cinnamon-buff. Usually the female builds
her globular shaped mud nest <i>under the eaves</i> of
an unpainted barn. Hundreds of mud pellets are
neatly welded together and an opening is left in
the front. As these swallows also build against
cliffs, they are known as cliff swallows in some
localities.</p>


<h3>June Fifth</h3>

<p>The nesting season is now at its height, and you
will soon see young birds about the grounds.
The old birds may be away looking for food.
Let us remember that it is better to let Nature
work out her own problems. Instead of catching
the birdlings and forcing them to eat unnatural
food (only to find them dead a few hours
later), put them back into the nest when it is
possible, or if they are strong enough, toss them
into the air and let them flutter to the branches of
a tree beyond the reach of cats.</p>


<h3>June Sixth</h3>

<p>This is about the time that turtles hunt for a
sandy bank in which to make a depression where
they may deposit their eggs&mdash;that look so much
like ping-pong balls. The eggs are covered with
sand and left for the sun to hatch. The young dig
through the shallow covering and take to the water.</p>

<h3>June Seventh</h3>

<p>If you wish to see one of the most gorgeous of
wood birds, the scarlet tanager, you must find him
now, for, after the nesting season, he loses his black
wings and tail and bright red dress, and dons the
sober green hue of his mate. You will find him
living in the maple groves, and the heavy forests
of maple, oak, beech, and chestnut. His song,
though not so loud as either, resembles both that
of the robin and the rose-breasted grosbeak.</p>


<h3>June Eighth</h3>

<p>In the low-lying meadows, and in the marshes,
the towering stems of the blue flag, or blue iris,
have already blossomed. Nature has so constructed
this handsome flower, that were it not for
the visits of bees, and other insects, its seeds would
remain unfertilized.</p>


<h3>June Ninth</h3>

<p>The orchard oriole is far from common north of
the States parallel with southern New York. It
migrates to Central America in winter, as does its
cousin, the Baltimore oriole, who is named for
Lord Baltimore. It lives in orchards, and you
should look in apple and pear trees for its graceful
pendent nest, built of the stems and blades of grass
neatly woven together, like the nest of a weaver
bird.</p>

<h3>June Tenth</h3>

<p>When by pure strategy you have outwitted a pair
of bobolinks, and have succeeded in finding their
nest, you have indeed achieved a triumph. To be
successful, take your field-glasses, and secrete yourself
near a meadow where you can watch a pair of
bobolinks without being seen. Wait until one or
both birds have made repeated trips to a certain
spot, then with eyes riveted on the place, hurry
forward, and as the bird rises, drop your hat on the
spot and search carefully about it until the nest is
found.</p>


<h3>June Eleventh</h3>

<p>The robin, song sparrow, vesper sparrow, chipping
sparrow, ph&#339;be, and house wren by this time
have their first fledglings out of the nest. They
usually raise two, and sometimes three broods in a
season. While the father bird is busy caring for
the youngsters, the mother is building another nest
or laying a second set of eggs.</p>


<h3>June Twelfth</h3>

<p>In damp low-lying fields at this season, beds of
bog cotton decorate the landscape. Its silken
tassels sway gracefully in the breeze, and at a
distance one could easily mistake them for true
flowers.</p>

<h3>June Thirteenth</h3>

<p>Although the meadow lark and the flicker are
about the same size, and each has a black patch on
its breast, they need never be confused. The flight,
as well as the difference in color, should help in
their identification. The flicker's flight is undulating;
while the meadow lark flies steadily, and
the wings move rapidly between short periods
of sailing. Again, the meadow lark's <i>outer tail
feathers</i> are white, while the flicker's <i>rump</i> is white,
both of which can be seen when the birds fly.</p>


<h3>June Fourteenth</h3>

<p>Visit the pool or waterway where you discovered
the toad's eggs and you will find that they have
hatched. The little black polliwogs, or tadpoles,
have eaten their way out of the gelatine prison and
are now schooled at the edge of the water. They
subsist upon the decaying vegetation and minute
animal life.</p>


<h3>June Fifteenth</h3>

<p>Our lawns are now the feeding ground of the
first brood of young robins, great overgrown,
gawky, mottle-breasted children, nearly as large
as their parents. What a ludicrous sight it is to see
them following their mother about, flapping their
wings, opening their mouths, and begging for food
every time she approaches them.</p>

<h3>June Sixteenth</h3>

<p>Leopard frogs and tiger frogs are often found in
the tall grass a mile or so from water. Food is
abundant and more easily caught in such places
than along the streams. By the waterways the
frog waits patiently for insects to pass, then springs
at one with open mouth and, whether successful or
not, he falls back into the water, swims ashore,
and awaits another morsel.</p>


<h3>June Seventeenth</h3>

<p>A family of six young belted kingfishers perching
on the edge of a bank, preparatory to taking their
first flight, is a laughable sight indeed. Their
immense helmet-like crests, their short legs, and
their steel blue backs, give them a "cocky" appearance,
and remind one of a squad of policemen on
dress parade.</p>


<h3>June Eighteenth</h3>

<p>If the bird observer upon his first birding trip
could be introduced to the song of a winter wren,
there is scarcely a doubt that he would be a bird
enthusiast from that minute. Mrs. Florence Merriam
Bailey has come nearest to describing its
song; "Full of trills, runs, and grace notes, it was
a tinkling, rippling roundelay."</p>

<h3>June Nineteenth</h3>

<p>Throughout the mountainous region of the
eastern States, the mountain laurel (spoonwood,
broad-leafed kalmia, or calico bush) is in full
blossom. It is a beautiful, sweet-scented, flowering
shrub, and the bushes are ruthlessly destroyed by
those who have no regard for Nature's future
beauty.</p>


<h3>June Twentieth</h3>

<p>The habits of wasps and bees differ widely.
Both orders are very intelligent. Wild bees live
in hollow trees and make their cells of wax. At
first they feed their young on "bee bread," which
is made from the pollen of flowers, and afterward
on honey. Wasps subsist on the juices of fruits,
and insects; but they will eat meat. They make
their homes in burrows in the ground, or in wood,
or they construct nests of paper or mud.</p>


<h3>June Twenty-first</h3>

<p>The Maryland yellow-throat is more like a wren
than a warbler, but it belongs to the warbler family.
As you pass a thicket or a swamp, he shouts
"<i>This way sir, this way sir, this way sir</i>;" or
"<i>Witchety, witchety, witchety</i>;" and you might watch
for hours without seeing him. But by placing the
back of your hand against your lips, and making
a low squeaking noise, you are likely to bring him
to the top of a reed or bush.</p>

<h3>June Twenty-second</h3>

<p>It is quite easy to tell the difference between
butterflies and moths. Remember, first of all, that
butterflies are <i>sunlight</i> loving insects, while moths
stir about only on cloudy days, or after dark.
Butterflies, when at rest, hold their wings together
over their backs; moths carry them open and
parallel with the body. Again, the antennæ, or
"feelers," of butterflies are quite club-like in shape,
while the "feelers" of moths inhabiting the United
States and Canada resemble tiny feathers.</p>


<h3>June Twenty-third</h3>

<p>If you are so fortunate as to have a pair of catbirds
nesting in a <i>small tree</i> or a <i>bush</i> near your
house, you have learned that the male is an accomplished
songster. Have you ever noticed the father
bird, when perched where he can overlook the nest,
gently quivering his wings as though delighted at
the thought of a nest full of little ones? After the
eggs have hatched, these periods of delight are
more frequent.</p>


<h3>June Twenty-fourth</h3>

<p>The bracket fungi that are attached to the trunks
of forest and shade trees live to an old age. Some
have been found over seventy-five years old. They
are the fruit of the fungous growth that is living on
and destroying the tissues of the tree. The puff-balls
are edible fungi before they have dried.</p>

<h3>June Twenty-fifth</h3>

<p>Some one has rightly called young Baltimore
orioles the "cry-babies of the bird world." The
approach of their mother with food is the sign for
a general outcry, and even during her absence, they
whimper softly, like disconsolate children. For the
next ten days you may hear them in the shade-trees
about our streets, particularly after a rain.</p>


<h3>June Twenty-sixth</h3>

<p>The long-billed marsh wren is found in tall, rank
vegetation bordering rivers and lakes, and in the
marshes at tide water. It nests in colonies in the
rushes, and the male will build several other nests
near the one his mate occupies. "While singing
it is usually seen clinging to the side of some tall
swaying reed, with its tail bent forward so far as
almost to touch its head." (Chapman.)</p>


<h3>June Twenty-seventh</h3>

<p>The kingbird, because of its pugnacity, is considered
a ruler of other birds, although it might
rightly be called a watchman and protector of the
feathered world. It is a sober colored bird, save
for the concealed patch of orange on the crown of
the head. It is always the first bird to detect the
presence of a feathered enemy. With loud, defiant
cries it sallies forth to attack, and is not content
until it has driven the intruder beyond range.</p>

<h3>June Twenty-eighth</h3>

<p>The spittle insect, or spittle bug, <i>not a snake,
frog, or grasshopper</i>, is responsible for that bit of
froth found on the stems of weeds and grasses.
Push away the foam, and you will find a small,
helpless insect apparently half-drowned. The liquid
is a secretion from the body, whipped into froth by
the creature's struggles. These are the larvæ of the
insects which, when full grown, fly up before you
in myriads as you walk through the fields.</p>


<h3>June Twenty-ninth</h3>

<p>The swallows are noted for their strong and
graceful flight. Watch one, as he sails gracefully
through the air, now swerving to the right, now to
the left, and then dipping down to take a drink or
to pick an insect from the water, scarcely making a
ripple. The barn and eave swallows feed their
young in mid air. It would appear that they are
fighting, when the food is being passed from the old
bird to the youngster.</p>


<h3>June Thirtieth</h3>

<p>A common bird along the country roads is the
indigo bunting, or indigo bird. He perches on a
wire, or on the topmost limb of a tall bush or tree,
and sings a song quite sparrow-like in quality.
As you approach, he drops gracefully into the
foliage. His nest probably contains young birds.</p>

<h2><a name="July" id="July"><span class="antiqua">July</span></a></h2>


<h3>July First</h3>

<p>After a shower in early July, myriads of tiny
toads swarm on the lawns and walks. They have
just abandoned their aquatic life as tadpoles, and
have taken up a terrestrial mode of living. Their
skin is so delicate that sunlight kills them, so they
remain hidden until clouds have obscured the sun.</p>


<h3>July Second</h3>

<p>"<i>Whip-poor-will, whip-poor-will, whip-poor-will.</i>"
From dusk until daylight you hear its
mournful song. The whip-poor-will spends the
day in the forest. At twilight it comes forth to
catch its insect prey, which it captures while flying.
It makes hardly any pretence at building a nest,
but lays its eggs upon the ground among the leaves,
and so closely do both bird and eggs resemble their
surroundings, that one might easily step on them
unknowingly.</p>


<h3>July Third</h3>

<p>Attached to stones, stumps, and tree trunks along
the fresh water ponds and streams, are the cast-off
jackets of the larval dragon-fly. These larvæ
remain in the water for more than a year, feeding
upon the larvæ of other insects. Finally they leave
the water, and a long rent is seen on the creature's
back, and soon the dragon-fly appear.</p>

<h3>July Fourth</h3>

<p>Similar to the whip-poor-will in shape, the
nighthawk, or bullbat, differs from it in song and
habits,&mdash;though, oddly enough, it perches lengthwise
on a limb as the whip-poor-will does. <i>It is
neither a hawk nor a bat</i>, for it is classed close to
the chimney swift, and like the swift, it is of inestimable
value as an insect destroyer. It is often
seen in the daytime and the large white spot on
the under side of each wing helps to identify it.</p>


<h3>July Fifth</h3>

<p>The horned-tails are the large wasp-like insects
that we see about the elm, oak, and maple trees.
They bore holes a quarter of an inch in diameter in
the tree trunk, and in these holes the eggs are laid.
Sometimes they get their augers wedged and are
unable to free themselves. The horned-tails are
destructive, and should be killed whenever found.
They sometimes remain in the pupa state so long,
that the tree may be cut down and the wood made
into furniture before they finally emerge.</p>


<h3>July Sixth</h3>

<p>Before now you have probably seen the ruby-throated
hummingbird poising over the flowers
in your garden. Sometimes he goes through strange
antics. Mounting ten or fifteen feet into the air,
he swoops down in a graceful curve, then turns and
repeats the performance time and time again.</p>

<h3>July Seventh</h3>

<p>In travelling from burrow to burrow, woodchucks
often make roads a quarter of a mile long through
the grass. Occasionally you will get a long distance
view of the "'chuck" as he scuds to the mouth of his
hole, and rising on his hind legs, stands erect and
watches you, then bobs out of sight. He is the
most alert and keen-eyed of all American rodents,
and his presence in such numbers, despite the war
waged upon him, proves his ability to take care
of himself.</p>


<h3>July Eighth</h3>

<p>"The interrupted fern is less a lover of moisture
than its kindred. The fertile fronds are usually
taller than the sterile leaves, and they remain green
all summer. The spore-bearing organs are produced
near the middle of the frond" (Clute), thus
"interrupting" the pinnæ growth of the leaf. It
is also called Clayton's fern.</p>


<h3>July Ninth</h3>

<p>The hind feet of a honey bee are provided with
stiff fringes. With these the bee scrapes from the
rings of its body the oily substance that is exuded,
and passes it to the mouth. After chewing and
working it between the mandibles (for the bee has
mouth-parts for biting, and a proboscis for sucking
the juices and honey from plants), it becomes soft
and is then built into comb.</p>

<h3>July Tenth</h3>

<p>From the depths of the forest and thick underbrush,
you will hear the "<i>teacher</i>, <span class="smcap">teacher</span>,
TEACHER, <i>TEACHER</i>" (in a swift crescendo)
of the golden-crowned thrush, ovenbird, or teacher-bird.
It is a note of such volume that, instead of a
bird the size of a robin, you are surprised to find
that the songster is no larger than a song sparrow.
He is called ovenbird because his nest is covered
over and resembles somewhat an old-fashion bake
oven.</p>

<h3>July Eleventh</h3>

<p>Some "glow-worms" are female fire-flies or
lightning-bugs. There are at least a score of common
insects that are luminous, besides some rare
ones. With some species of fire-flies (our common
fire-fly included) both sexes are winged, while
with others the females lack wings and are known
as "glow-worms."</p>


<h3>July Twelfth</h3>

<p>With most birds, the female only builds the nest
and incubates the eggs, after which both birds
usually assist in bringing up the young. Some of
the exceptions to this rule are the male Bob-white,
house wren, catbird, blue-headed, yellow-throated,
and warbling vireos, and the barn and eave swallows,
each of which does his share of the domestic
duties and takes care of the young birds.</p>

<h3>July Thirteenth</h3>

<p>Through ignorance we often persecute our best
friends. The ichneumon fly is a parasitic insect
that all should know. It lays its eggs in the larvæ
of many injurious insects, and its larvæ feeds upon
them. A great enemy to the horned-tails, it is
invariably misjudged and killed, when discovered
with its ovipositor inserted in one of the borings of
the horned-tail fly.</p>


<h3>July Fourteenth</h3>

<p>How beautiful is the awakening of the evening
primrose. No sooner is the sun beneath the horizon,
than the calyx begins to swell and out springs a
yellow petal. Then another and another appear
before your very eyes, until the petals look like the
blades of a screw propeller. The blossom is often
less then five minutes in opening, and is immediately
surrounded by tiny black insects.</p>


<h3>July Fifteenth</h3>

<p>Young spotted sandpipers, or "tip-ups," are
able to leave their nest (in a slight depression in
the ground) soon after the eggs hatch. It is indeed
interesting to watch a family of these animated
woolly balls on stilts, running along the shore with
their parents. When pursued they sometimes will
take to the water and cling to the vegetation on the
bottom.</p>

<h3>July Sixteenth</h3>

<p>The perfectly round white heads of the button
bush are now conspicuous along the streams, bogs,
and lakes. The long slender styles project from
all sides like the quills on the back of a frightened
hedgehog. Although this shrub is a lover of water
and damp soil, "it is sometimes found on elevated
ground, where it serves, it is claimed, as a good
sign of the presence of a hidden spring. The inner
bark is sometimes used as a cough medicine."
(Newhall.)</p>


<h3>July Seventeenth</h3>

<p>During the haying season the birds hold high
carnival. Robins, song and chipping sparrows,
orioles, bobolinks, goldfinches, meadow larks, and
flickers, all feed upon the insects that are now so
easy to catch. A seat in the shade overlooking a
new mown field is at present a good point from
which to study birds.</p>


<h3>July Eighteenth</h3>

<p>Huckleberries, red raspberries, and shad or
service-berries, when ripe, are eaten by birds,
squirrels, and chipmunks during the day, while at
night various species of mice harvest them. The
choke-cherries, elderberries, and blackberries are
beginning to lose their bright red color, and they,
too, will soon be feeding Nature's people.</p>

<h3>July Nineteenth</h3>

<p>The pickerel-weed and arrow-head are in full
bloom side by side at the water's edge of stream
and pond. The blue flower-heads of the former
contrast strikingly with the round white blossoms
of the latter.</p>


<h3>July Twentieth</h3>

<p>The female flies and mosquitoes are the ones
that bite, and it is the female and the worker bees
and wasps that sting. The males of the two former
groups are not provided with blood-sucking mouth
parts, and the males of the bees and wasps lack
stingers. When a less offensive remedy is not at
hand, insect tormentors may be kept away by
rubbing a piece of fat pork or bacon on one's face
and hands.</p>


<h3>July Twenty-first</h3>

<p>The leaf-cutting bees resemble the bumblebees.
Examine the bushes and trees and you will find
circular holes in the leaves from which pieces have
been cut. Hundreds of these tiny bits are used to
line the rows of cells that the bees make in the
ground or in wood. The cells are filled with pollen
for the young bees to feed upon when they emerge
from the eggs that are laid on top of the supply
of "bee-bread."</p>

<h3>July Twenty-second</h3>

<p>Do you miss the rollicking song of the bobolink?
Have you seen him recently in his spring dress of
black and white? No; he has sung himself silent,
and, as though in hope of escaping the guns of the
Southern rice planters, whose crops he will plunder
on his way South, he has disguised himself in a
plumage of buff color, streaked with brown, quite
like that of his mate.</p>


<h3>July Twenty-third</h3>

<p>"The summer is nearly over when the Joe-Pie
weed (purple boneset) begins to tinge with 'crushed
raspberry' the lowlands through which we pass.
'Joe Pie' is supposed to have been the name of
an Indian who cured typhus fever in New England
by means of this plant." (Dana.)</p>


<h3>July Twenty-fourth</h3>

<p>The ostrich fern is so named because the dark
green fertile fronds which appear about this time,
and form the centre of the vase-shaped leaf-cluster,
resemble ostrich plumes. Mr. Clute says: "It
is at its best in wet, sandy soil of a half-shaded
island or river shore. Its development is rapid,
often lengthening six inches in a day."</p>

<h3>July Twenty-fifth</h3>

<p>A cuckoo pleading for her nest of young would
soften a heart of stone. With wings and tail spread,
she flutters almost into one's face, uttering pathetic
and heartrending cries that beseech you not to
touch her treasures. In pinfeathers the young of
this bird, as well as those of the chimney swift,
resemble baby European hedgehogs.</p>


<h3>July Twenty-sixth</h3>

<p>Trees and flowers must sleep as well as animals.
The dandelion closes its petals late in the afternoon,
and as night approaches the water lily folds up
tightly. Although summer in the North is shorter
than the summer in the South, the days are several
hours longer, so vegetation is growing here while
their trees and flowers are sleeping. This provision
of Nature gives the northern Indian vegetables and
flowers in a country which we often call "a land
of snow and ice."</p>


<h3>July Twenty-seventh</h3>

<p>The common milkweed is another one of Nature's
fly traps. Examine some of the fragrant flower
heads and you are almost sure to find a captive held
firmly by the foot. "The silky hairs of the seed-pods
have been used for stuffing pillows and mattresses,
and can be mixed with flax or wool and
woven to advantage." (Dana.)</p>

<h3>July Twenty-eighth</h3>

<p>One of the simplest duties of a spider's life, is
the stretching of a parallel web. Tiring of her
location, the spider begins to spin a thread, or
tangle a mass of threads together, until they are of
sufficient buoyancy to support her weight. Then
she fastens one end of a strand to the point she is
about to leave, and clinging to the under side of
her improvised balloon, floats away with the breeze.
She pays out silk until the thread parts, or she
finally comes in contact with some object, and so
the cable is laid.</p>


<h3>July Twenty-ninth</h3>

<p>Young song sparrows, chipping sparrows, field
sparrows, cedar-birds, bluebirds, and robins are
streaked and mottled on the breast during the
first few months of their lives. Another noticeable
fact is that young birds fluff their feathers, and as
the old birds are often thin from care and worry,
the youngsters seem larger than their parents.</p>


<h3>July Thirtieth</h3>

<p>The dobson, or "hellgrammite," is honored
with about sixteen other names. Its chalky-white
mass of eggs about the size of a dime are now
common objects along inland waterways. As soon
as the eggs hatch, the young dobsons drop into the
water and hide beneath stones for three years,
feeding on aquatic larvæ of insects.</p>

<p>The river crab, or crawfish, has five pairs of
walking legs and six pairs of swimming legs. If
a leg is lost, another will grow within a year. The
female lays a large number of eggs, which are
attached to the fringes of her body. These crabs
have two pairs of antenna-like organs, one to feel
with and the other for hearing. The compound
eyes are set on two pegs that can be protruded or
depressed at will.</p>

<h3>August First</h3>

<p>The mid-air gyrations of the kingbird are not
very often seen. Flying some distance into the air,
the bird utters a series of indescribable notes, and
as he does so, he dodges, twists, and zigzags through
the air as though trying to escape the talons of a
hawk. After repeating the performance several
times, he sails gracefully to a perch on a telegraph
wire or the topmost twig of a tree or a bush.</p>


<h3>August Second</h3>

<p>During the summer, gray squirrels leave their
winter homes, in hollow tree trunks and limbs, and
construct summer nests. These nests are simply
balls of leaves placed in oak, chestnut, maple, or
beech trees. A squirrel will build several nests
close to one another, from which he never wanders
far.</p>


<h3>August Third</h3>

<p>The <i>aphides</i>, or plant lice, are known to every
horticulturist and lover of flowers. They cluster
on the under side of leaves, causing them to curl
and wither. There are a great many species, and
they are the insects that the ants care for. They
are sometimes called "ant's cows," because they
secrete a sweet substance of which ants are very
fond.</p>

<h3>August Fourth</h3>

<p>The clusters of white berries of the red-twigged
osier, or kinnikinnik, so common in damp localities,
will turn blue later on. The northern Indians
remove the thin outer bark from the twigs, and
after scraping off the inner green bark with a knife,
they dry it over a camp fire, powder it between the
palms of the hand, then mix it with tobacco and
smoke it.</p>


<h3>August Fifth</h3>

<p>The ant lion is the peculiar larva of a fly. It
forms small, funnel-like depressions in the dry
sand or dust, throwing out the grains with its broad,
flat head. You probably have seen an unfortunate
ant struggling desperately to gain the top of the
death pit. Gradually the drifting sand carries it
nearer and nearer the jaws of the ant lion, waiting
at the bottom, and finally it falls a victim to Nature's
ingenuity.</p>


<h3>August Sixth</h3>

<p>The moist and shaded highland where the
thorn apple, willow, red-twigged osier, and second-growth
maples thrive, is the haunt of the mild and
timid woodcock. Tracks in the mud may be seen
where one has been walking about, and here and
there clusters of holes smaller than a lead pencil
tell that it has been "boring" for worms with its
long, sensitive bill.</p>

<h3>August Seventh</h3>

<p>The harvest fly (cicada, "lyre-man," or dog-day
locust) is really not a <i>locust</i>. Unlike its relative,
the seventeen-year locust, which for seventeen
years remains in the ground, a larva, it produces
young yearly. In the woods and villages, its
monotonous buzzing, sizzling note is heard, and is
taken as a sign of warm weather.</p>


<h3>August Eighth</h3>

<p>As though ashamed of man's carelessness.
Nature covers the fire-swept forests with beds of
purple flowers, called "fireweed." Sometimes acre
after acre of these tall flowers sway back and forth
beneath the charred or naked tree trunks, a
pleasant relief to the eye of the traveller.</p>


<h3>August Ninth</h3>

<p>Look carefully among the leafy boughs and you
may find the home of a leaf-rolling caterpillar.
"The little creature begins by spinning a thread
and fastening one end to some fixed point, and
then attaches the other end to the loose leaf. By
means of powerful, muscular movements of the
front part of the body, ... it hauls away on
the ropes, slowly pulling it to the desired point,
where it is held in place by a new and stronger
thread. In this tent it resides, eating out the
interior, and adding new stores of food, by sewing
new leaves to the outside of the tent." (Packard.)</p>

<h3>August Tenth</h3>

<p>Families of barn and eave swallows now begin
to congregate and to act restlessly. Flocks of
red-shouldered blackbirds, mixed with purple and
bronzed grackles, feed silently in the willows along
the waterways, or are flushed from the grain fields.
In the woods the chickadees, vireos, and warblers
of many kinds keep company while they search
among the trees for food. These are the first real
signs to make the bird lover feel his feathered
friends are soon to leave him.</p>


<h3>August Eleventh</h3>

<p>The muskrats now begin to build their winter
houses, mounds of leaves, sticks, reeds, and aquatic
vegetation, brought from the borders or the bottom
of the ponds and streams, and piled from two to
four feet above the surface of the water. The
entrance to the <i>one large chamber</i> is always below
the surface, and in this snug room a family of muskrats
will spend the winter, but they <i>do not hibernate</i>.</p>


<h3>August Twelfth</h3>

<p>The Indian pipe, or corpse flower, is found only
in heavily shaded woods. Like the fungi, to which
it is kin, it subsists on decaying vegetation. Its
ashy color and queer, fantastic shape make you
hesitate to pick it, and after you have overcome the
feeling and snipped off the stem, you find that it
soon turns black, and is useless as an ornament.</p>

<h3>August Thirteenth</h3>

<p>Queen Anne's lace, wild carrot, and bird's nest,
are the names given to the delicate, white lace-like
flower which grows in such abundance in the open
countries throughout the eastern States. Several
flat-topped flower heads are arranged on stems
along the stalk, and after the flowers have bloomed
the stems of each head contract and form a sort of
basket about the size of a hummingbird's nest.</p>


<h3>August Fourteenth</h3>

<p>"Now comes the season of our insect instrumentalists....
I have called them instrumentalists,
for there are no insects, to my knowledge,
that make any sounds with their mouths; they
seem to be entirely void of vocal organs....
The song is produced by the rubbing or beating
of some portion of the body against some other
portion, these portions being so modified as to
produce the rasping sound." (Brownell.)</p>


<h3>August Fifteenth</h3>

<p>The small-mouthed black bass is one of the
gamiest of our fresh water fish. "The eggs are
bound together in bands of ribbons by an adhesive
substance. They adhere to stones on which they
are deposited. The small-mouthed black bass
ceases to take food on the approach of cold weather,
and remains nearly dormant throughout the winter." (Bean.)</p>

<h3>August Sixteenth</h3>

<p>Often spending the entire winter in southern
New York and New England, the American goldfinch
and the cedar waxwing are the latest birds
to begin nest building. The young have just now
left the nest, while the other birds have long since
ceased their domestic duties, and the white-breasted
swallow will soon start on his southward journey.</p>


<h3>August Seventeenth</h3>

<p>If you will visit the zoological park at this time,
you will find that since you last saw the buck
deer, the antlers have hardened-like bone. The
velvet, too, is hanging from them in shreds, and
the buck thrashes his antlers against the bushes,
and rubs them on the tree trunks, in an effort to
rid them of the velvet. Soon they will be in prime
condition for battle with his rivals or his enemies.</p>


<h3>August Eighteenth</h3>

<p>Children believe that a hair from the tail or mane
of a horse will turn into a snake if left in water
long enough. The so-called "hair snake" lives
in the bodies of insects, such as grasshoppers,
crickets, and beetles. The eggs of the <i>worm</i> are
taken into the system when the insect drinks. Once
hatched, the worm gnaws at its victim's vitals until
the insect dies. They take to the water when full
grown and lay their eggs in a long chain.</p>

<h3>August Nineteenth</h3>

<p>There are more than eighty species of our
national flower, the golden-rod, in the United States.
While a cluster of golden heads swaying in the
breeze is beautiful indeed, it is with regret that we
watch its ripening, for, like the harvesting of grain,
and the flocking of bluebirds, it tells us of the
approaching autumn.</p>


<h3>August Twentieth</h3>

<p>The female mosquito lays her eggs in a mass,
that floats upon the surface of the water. The
larvæ are the "wigglers" that swim about in a
jerky sort of way in the rain barrels or pools of
stagnant water. They float near the surface and
breathe through a tube at the end of the body.
When ready to emerge from this larval stage, they
crawl out on a stick, stone, or bush, the skin on the
back splits, and the mosquito emerges.</p>


<h3>August Twenty-first</h3>

<p>The narrow spear-pointed leaves of the walking
fern cling to the moss-covered rocks, and in graceful
curves reach out until their tips touch the
ground and take root again. These fronds in turn
take up the march, and so they creep about the
rocks wherever there is soil sufficient for them to
get a foothold. They are also reproduced by spores
in the regular fern-like way.</p>

<h3>August Twenty-second</h3>

<p>The fresh-water clam furnishes us with a good
quality of pearl, and from the shells pearl buttons
are made. Along the muddy bottom of our inland
lakes and rivers, you may see the clumsy writing
in the mud where they have crawled. During a
clam's infancy it lives a parasitic life, embedded
in the body of a fish. It then emerges and drops to
the bottom of the lake or river, where it spends the
remainder of its life.</p>


<h3>August Twenty-third</h3>

<p>"Those horrid tomato worms are eating all my
plants. They are positively the most repulsive
creatures I know." A few weeks later a beautiful
sphinx moth flutters into your chamber window.
Do you recognize it as your hated enemy? It is
he,&mdash;a "wolf in sheep's clothing."</p>


<h3>August Twenty-fourth</h3>

<p>The cardinal flower, or red lobelia, lives in the
marshes and along the streams, where it often
trespasses so near the brink, that a slight freshet
floods its roots. "We have no flower which can
compare with this in vivid coloring." (Dana.)
In some localities it has been in bloom for weeks.</p>

<h3>August Twenty-fifth</h3>

<p>Some evening after a thunder-shower, take a
light and stroll along the garden path, or by the
flower bed. Go slowly and step with caution, and
you will see large numbers of angle worms&mdash;"night
walkers" the fishermen call them&mdash;stretched
out on the ground. Half of their length is
hidden in the hole, ready at the slightest jar or
noise to pull the remainder underground.</p>


<h3>August Twenty-sixth</h3>

<p>Woodchucks, or "groundhogs," are very busy
at this season of the year. They work overtime
even on moonlight nights, for they have a contract
with Nature to blanket themselves with layers of
fat half an inch thick. If the contract is not filled
before winter sets in, death may be the forfeit.
Eat, eat, eat; they spend every minute digging up
the grass roots, and eating off the clover heads, and
they often make excursions into the farmer's
garden.</p>


<h3>August Twenty-seventh</h3>

<p>Butter-and-eggs prefers the unsheltered lands
where the sun can beat upon it. It came from
Europe and "like nearly all common weeds this
plant has been utilized in various ways by the
country people. It yields what was considered at
one time a valuable skin lotion, while its juices
mingled with milk constitutes a fly poison." (Dana.)</p>

<h3>August Twenty-eighth</h3>

<p>Be sure to kill any bee-like insect that you see
hovering about your horse's fore legs, for it is a
bot-fly. After the eggs have been attached to the
horse's leg-hairs, they hatch and the horse licks the
larvæ and swallows them. Attaching themselves
to the walls of the stomach, they live there for
some time, but finally pass through the horse and
fall to the ground, where they transform into bot-flies.</p>


<h3>August Twenty-ninth</h3>

<p>The solitary sandpiper is one of the early migrating
birds that is now returning from its northern
nesting grounds. It is always found near water,
singly or in twos and threes. It has a habit of
holding its wings over its head as it alights, showing
conspicuously their dark tips. Like all sandpipers,
it is not supposed to perch in trees or bushes;
nevertheless it does so frequently when a person
approaches its young or its nest.</p>


<h3>August Thirtieth</h3>

<p>Have you ever watched a spider making its web?
The sticky fluid, which becomes a silk strand upon
coming in contact with the air, pours from several
holes, or spinnerets, at the end of the body. The
threads are guided by the feet, and when the spinnerets
are held apart, several strands are spun, but
by contracting them one heavy rope is made.</p>

<h3>August Thirty-first</h3>

<p>Most crickets die at the approach of winter, but
some hibernate. It is only the males that sing, and
they do it by rubbing together the inner edges of the
outside wings. They live on the moisture from
the roots of various kinds of vegetables, and are not
above eating insects.</p>

<h3>September First</h3>

<p>In various localities the Oswego tea is known as
"bee balm," "fragrant balm," "Indian plume,"
and "mountain mint." "The bee balm especially
haunts those cool brooks, and its rounded flower-clusters
touch with warmth the shadows of the deep
woods of midsummer. The Indians named the
flower, <i>o-gee-chee</i>, 'flaming flower,' and are said
to have made a tea-like decoction from the
blossoms." (Dana.)</p>


<h3>September Second</h3>

<p>Small mammals are abundant in the Adirondacks.
Chipmunks and red squirrels are very tame, and if
one sits still in the woods they will approach within
a few feet. By watching at the base of logs and
stumps, you can often see a red-backed mouse or a
long-tailed shrew. The latter is the smallest of
American mammals, its body being scarcely two
inches in length.</p>


<h3>September Third</h3>

<p>Mr. Scudder says that katydids have a day and
a night song. He has watched one, and when a
cloud obscured the sky, it, and all of those within
his hearing, stopped singing and began their night
song, but as soon as the sun came out, they again
changed to their original song.</p>

<h3>September Fourth</h3>

<p>What a fine time the robins, cedar-birds, catbirds,
and flickers are having in the choke-cherry bushes
these days! Twenty or thirty of them may fly from
a bush of ripened fruit as you approach. The
streaked and speckled breasted young robins and
cedar-birds are loath to leave their feast.</p>


<h3>September Fifth</h3>

<p>It is hard to believe that the yellow butterflies with
the black tips and spots on their wings, so common
about moist spots in the road, were once cabbage
worms. Mr. Packard says that this species was
introduced from Europe to Quebec about 1857.
It rapidly spread into New England and has reached
as far south as Washington, D. C. About Quebec it
annually destroys $250,000 worth of cabbages.</p>


<h3>September Sixth</h3>

<p>The bottle, closed, or blind gentian loves the
damp fields and somewhat open road-sides. It
resembles a cluster of bright blue buds about to
open, but they never do. Neltje Blanchan says
that bumblebees have hard work to rob it of its
nectar and pollen. Climbing clumsily over the
corolla, it finds the space between the lips and
forces its head and trunk through the opening.
Presently it backs out, and, with its feet and velvety
body covered with pollen, flies away to fertilize
some other gentian.</p>

<h3>September Seventh</h3>

<p>Muskrats, like children, make "collections."
A muskrat's "playhouse" is usually placed on a
partly submerged stump, log, boulder, or the float
of a boat-house. In some such place is piled all
sorts of rubbish,&mdash;sticks, stones, bones, iron, glass,
clam shells, and what not. Near by one may find
a thick mat of aquatic grass, used by the owner as
a resting-place. When camped in the vicinity of a
playhouse, you will hear the clink of touching
stones at night, and the splash of water.</p>


<h3>September Eighth</h3>

<p>Damp, shaded flats along streams or spring-holes,
are where the jewel-weed, or touch-me-not, clusters.
The orange-colored blossoms have gone to seed
and hang in tiny pods upon the stems. Touch one,
and if it is ripe, it will burst with a suddenness that
startles you.</p>


<h3>September Ninth</h3>

<p>You must be unfamiliar with the country if you
have never felt the sting of the nettle. The rib of
the nettle leaf is armed with tiny, hollow spines,
each of which is connected with a microscopic sack
or bulb filled with poison, called formic acid.
When the skin is pierced by the spines, the bulb is
pressed, and the poison injected into the wound.
Every boy of outdoor life knows that mud will
relieve the irritation.</p>

<h3>September Tenth</h3>

<p>The true locusts are the field insects commonly
called "grasshoppers." They belong to a class of
insects whose metamorphosis is not complete,&mdash;that
is, they do not go through all of the several
stages of transformation. The young, on emerging
from the ground where the eggs were laid the summer
previous, look like abnormal wingless grasshoppers.
Grasshoppers live but a single season.</p>


<h3>September Eleventh</h3>

<p>The little green heron will steal cautiously along
the water's edge, with head drawn in, and beak
pointed forward. Then he stops, and with a
sudden lunge catches a minnow or a polliwog in his
bill, and swallows it head foremost. When flushed,
he laboriously wings his way across the stream and,
alighting in the shallow water or in a tree, flirts his
tail, stretches his long neck, and stands motionless
a few minutes before starting on another fishing
trip.</p>


<h3>September Twelfth</h3>

<p>At this season the banks of the rivers and streams
shine with the golden blossoms of the wild sunflower,
artichoke, Canadian potato, or earth apple.
In late summer and early spring, freshets wash
away the earth, leaving the edible, tuberous roots
exposed for the muskrats, woodchucks, mice,
squirrels, chipmunks, and rabbits to feed upon.</p>

<h3>September Thirteenth</h3>

<p>Patiently Madam Spider sits and holds the cords
of her telegraph system, waiting for some unfortunate
to announce to her its capture. When she
receives this message, out she rushes, and while the
victim struggles she holds him with her legs, while
other legs are busy binding him with cords.</p>


<h3>September Fourteenth</h3>

<p>The American goldfinch is very much in evidence
these days. He sways back and forth on the heads
of the Canadian thistles, and clings to the ripened
sunflower heads, the fruit of which he is very fond.
When disturbed he flies away in graceful undulations,
calling back to you, "<i>Just-see-me-go;
just-see-me-go; just-see-me-go.</i>"</p>


<h3>September Fifteenth</h3>

<p>When overburdened with honey and bee-bread,
large numbers of honey bees are drowned while
attempting to cross wide stretches of water. Put
your hand in the water and let one crawl into the
palm. It will not sting so long as you do not
squeeze or touch it. Note the two dots of golden
pollen adhering to the cups on the hind feet. Gradually
the bee regains strength and begins to dry
itself. First fluttering its wings, then combing its
fuzzy head and trunk with its legs, finally it
is off in the direction of its hive.</p>

<h3>September Sixteenth</h3>

<p>Clinging to the old stump fences, and covering
the low bushes by the roadside, the wild clematis,
or traveller's joy, smiles at the wayfarer and defies
the efforts of the farmer to exterminate it. As the
blossom goes to seed, a charming, foamlike effect
is produced by the appearance of the many stamens
and pistils.</p>


<h3>September Seventeenth</h3>

<p>This week the rose-breasted grosbeak, kingbird,
Baltimore oriole, yellow warbler, ruby-throated
hummingbird and yellow-breasted chat will probably
leave for the South. They all pass beyond the
United States to winter, and most of them go to
Mexico, Central and South America. Good luck
to them on their long journey, and may they all
live to return to us again next summer.</p>


<h3>September Eighteenth</h3>

<p>The dense forests strewn with moss-covered logs,
stumps, and boulders, and the rocky, fern-clad
borders of woodland rivulets, are the home of the
winter wren. Quite like a mouse in actions, he

and out of the rocky crevices, until you quite
despair of guessing where he will next appear.</p>

<h3>September Nineteenth</h3>

<p>The next time you go into the country, catch
two or three locusts (grasshoppers), and examine
their bodies for locust mites. They are tiny
red mites usually clustered at the base of the grasshopper's
wings, and are easily found if you raise
the wings slightly and look under them. Often
they are found on house flies.</p>


<h3>September Twentieth</h3>

<p>Nature employs many ingenious devices for
distributing the seed of her plants. The downy
seeds of the Canadian thistle, dandelion, prickly
lettuce, dogbane, and milkweed are cast over the
land by the winds. The common tare, the jewel-weed,
and the wood sorrel have devices for throwing
their seeds. Seeds of many species of plants are
contained in burrs or "stickers" that adhere to the
coats of animals and are carried miles before they
are finally planted.</p>


<h3>September Twenty-first</h3>

<p>A belted kingfisher, when suddenly seized with
a fit of playfulness, will skim over the water and
plunge beneath the surface, sending the spray in
all directions. Emerging, he continues his flight,
repeating the performance every fifty feet or more,
at the same time "rattling" loudly as though in
great ecstasy.</p>

<h3>September Twenty-second</h3>

<p>The thick, chunky purple heads of the Canadian
thistle always attract the bumblebees, and you
find them as eager for its nectar as they were for
the Joe-Pie weed a month or so ago. It is wonderful
how much abuse a bumblebee will stand before
he loses his temper. He is much more tractable
than his cousin, the honey bee, or any of the wasps.</p>


<h3>September Twenty-third</h3>

<p>Some animals lay by a supply of fat for winter,
which they absorb while resting in comparative
quiet in their burrows. Others are endowed with
a hoarding instinct, so they gather and store nuts,
grain, seeds, and fruit to last them until spring,
while the remainder are forced to live upon the food
that the season affords them,&mdash;a life of privation,
in many instances.</p>


<h3>September Twenty-fourth</h3>

<p>The monarch butterfly is one of the common
butterflies seen in early fall. It is something of a
wanderer, going North in the spring and migrating
South in the fall. Have you ever watched them
floating through the air, high above your head and

<h3>September Twenty-fifth</h3>

<p>Fishermen often find piles of clam shells heaped
under the exposed roots of trees or stumps, at or
near the water's edge. This is the work of muskrats.
After carrying the clams from the bed of the
stream, the rats take them to the bank and leave
them for the sun to open. Then they eat the clams,
after which the shells are disposed of in little heaps.</p>


<h3>September Twenty-sixth</h3>

<p>Next to the red-shouldered hawk, the red-tailed
hawk is the most common of the large hawks in
Eastern North America. Although the farmers
shoot it on sight, and the barn-yard fowls hurry to
shelter at its cries, it is one of the farmer's best
friends, because of the great number of grasshoppers
and mice it captures. Its cry is a loud, high-pitched,
"long-drawn out squealing whistle which to my
ear suggests the sound of escaping steam." (Chapman.)</p>


<h3>September Twenty-seventh</h3>

<p>You hear the mitchella-vine spoken of as "partridge berry,"
"twin-berry," and "squaw-berry."
It is a small-leaved vine, very common in woods and
shaded thickets. Winter does not harm its fruit,
so it is a welcome treat to many birds and mammals
in early spring. The buds appear in pairs, which
form a double fruit with two eyes, or navels, thus
giving it the name of "twin-berry."</p>

<h3>September Twenty-eighth</h3>

<p>The water skate, or water strider, resembles
somewhat a "granddaddy longlegs." It runs about
over the surface of the water in search of microscopic
insects, casting grotesque shadows on the
bottom. It does not dive like the water boatman,
but if it chooses it can take wing, and is often seen
to spring into the air and grasp its prey.</p>


<h3>September Twenty-ninth</h3>

<p>Our common sunfish builds a nest of stones and
gravel on the bottom of a stream. "The male
watches the nest and drives away all intruders.
The species is usually hardy in captivity, but is
subject to fungus attacks, which yield readily to a
treatment with brackish water." (Bean.)</p>


<h3>September Thirtieth</h3>

<p>On moonlight nights skunks come out into the
fields to feed upon beetles and grasshoppers. They
are keen scented, and you will sometimes see where
their claws have assisted in securing an insect that
their nose has detected in the ground. They will
often approach a man carrying a lantern, and after
sniffing at it a few times will walk away and
resume their hunt.</p>

ones that leave this week are the scarlet tanager,
ovenbird, chimney swift, wood thrush, indigo
bunting, and redstart.</p>


<h3>October Second</h3>

<p>The workers and drone bumblebees die at the
approach of winter, but the queen takes shelter
under the bark of trees, in stone piles and in other
places which offer protection, where she remains
all winter. She then comes out and gathers moss
and grass for a nest, or she may appropriate the
deserted nest of a meadow mouse. After making
several wax cells, she fills them with pollen and
honey, deposits an egg in each cell, and when the
young hatch, they feed upon the sweets.</p>

<h3>October Fourth</h3>

<p>When surprised while feeding, gray squirrels
will resort to an ingenious method of escape. As
the hunter approaches, the squirrel will scurry to
the opposite side of the tree trunk, and as the
hunter changes his position, the squirrel does likewise,
keeping the trunk of the tree between itself
and the enemy.</p>


<h3>October Fifth</h3>

<p>It is not always the large winged birds with the
light bodies that fly the fastest. The swifts, grouse,
pigeons, and ducks are the swiftest of fliers, yet
they have heavy bodies and short or narrow wings.
The eagles, hawks, owls, buzzards, and herons,
on the other hand, have large wings and comparatively
light bodies, yet they are noted for
their slow and graceful flight, still they can fly long
distances.</p>


<h3>October Sixth</h3>

<p>The white-footed mouse, deer mouse, or wood
mouse, usually makes his home in a hollow stump,
limb, or tree trunk. To prove that he can scramble
up rough bark, as well as run upon the ground, he
frequently builds a large, bulky nest of dried grass
in a bush or low tree. These nests have a tiny
aperture in one or two sides, and they are nearly
always located in trees traversed by wild grape, or
other vines.</p>

<h3>October Seventh</h3>

<p>Insects "supply us with the sweetest of sweets,
our very best inks and dyes, and our finest robes
and tapers, to say nothing of various acids, lacs,
and waxes; while few, who have not studied the
subject, have any idea of the importance of insects
and their products as articles of human diet."
(Riley.)</p>


<h3>October Eighth</h3>

<p>Many an amateur sportsman has mistaken the
fall song of the peeper, coming from the tall forest
trees, for that of a game bird or mammal. It is
loud and clearer than the peeper's spring song,
but the resemblance is easily detected after one
knows that both songs are sung by the same frog.
Now since the wood birds have ceased to sing, its
song is quickly noticed.</p>


<h3>October Ninth</h3>

<p>In size, shape, and actions, the English robin is
similar to our bluebird, to which it is related. The
English blackbird is a <i>thrush</i>, and our robin is the
largest of American thrushes. In the Bermuda
Islands the catbird is called "blackbird."</p>

<h3>October Tenth</h3>

<p>"The flight of the flying fish is usually from
four to six feet above the water, and it is sustained
for fifty to one hundred feet. The general enlarged
pectoral fins act as wings, and furnish the motive
power.... On all up grades it gives a stiff wing-stroke
about every three feet, rises to overtop each
advancing wave, and drops as the wave rolls on,
like a stormy petrel." (Hornaday.)</p>


<h3>October Eleventh</h3>

<p>Mushrooms and apples are often seen resting in
the branches of trees. Should you examine one,
very likely you would find the marks of a rodent's
teeth in its sides. This is one of the ways a red
squirrel has of storing food. When he placed the
mushrooms there, did he know that they would dry
and be preserved? If so, why did not instinct tell
him that the apples would decay before spring?</p>


<h3>October Twelfth</h3>

<p>Once the alarm note of a crow is heard and its
meaning understood, you can always tell when
those keen-eyed birds have discovered a hawk or an
owl. "<i>Hak, hak, hak, hak, hak</i>," they call,
much louder, quicker, and in a higher key than the
regular "<i>caw, caw, caw</i>." Rarely do they strike a
hawk or owl, but they keep diving at it until it soars
beyond their reach, or takes shelter in a tree.</p>

<h3>October Thirteenth</h3>

<p>If you can surprise a muskrat in a small pond,
notice that he does not use his front feet (which are
not webbed) in swimming; but, like the frog and
the toad, holds them close against the sides of his
body. Ordinarily the tail is used as a rudder, but
when he is hard pressed, he whirls it round and
round so that it acts like a screw propeller.</p>


<h3>October Fourteenth</h3>

<p>The brook trout is another fish that builds a nest.
It makes a hollow in the bed of a brook or a spring,
pushing the gravel aside with its nose, and carrying
the stones in its mouth. By using its tail the
cavity is shaped and then filled with pebbles, on
which the eggs are laid, and covered with gravel.
These "spawning" beds can now be seen in any
spring-fed trout stream.</p>


<h3>October Fifteenth</h3>

<p>As soon as the foliage falls from the trees it is
easy to collect birds' nests; and it is no sin to do so
then, inasmuch as the birds mentioned this week
rarely use the same nest a second season. Take a
trip into the country with the sole object of hunting
for nests, and you will be surprised to see how many
you can find. One hundred and ninety-eight bird
homes have been counted during a three hours'
walk. When it is possible to take a part of the
limb to which a nest is attached, it is best to do so.</p>

<h3>October Sixteenth</h3>

<p>Besides the large pendent nest of the Baltimore
and the orchard orioles, skilfully suspended from
the end of an elm, maple, apple, or pear tree limb,
you will find many smaller <i>hanging</i> nests built by
the several species of vireos. They are about the
size of a tennis-ball; made of birch bark, paper,
and pieces of dried leaves, fastened with spider and
caterpillar webs, and they are lined with dried pine
needles or dried grass.</p>


<h3>October Seventeenth</h3>

<p>The American goldfinch, "thistlebird" or
"wild canary," usually places its nest in the angle
of three twigs at the end of a slender branch that
is nearly or quite perpendicular. The nest is larger
than a base-ball, deeply hollowed and composed
outwardly of pieces of cotton waste, plant fibres
and fine bark, with a thick lining of willow or dandelion
down, and other soft material.</p>


<h3>October Eighteenth</h3>

<p>The chebec (least flycatcher), wood pewee, and
blue-gray gnat-catcher saddle their nests on the
upper side of limbs, as the hummingbird does, and
they use the same variety of material. They are so
delicate in construction that a severe storm will
send them to the ground.</p>

<h3>October Nineteenth</h3>

<p>The bulky basket nests of the cedar-bird and
kingbird are usually found saddled on a horizontal
limb in an orchard. The kingbird prefers to be
near water, and will often use an elm, willow, or
thorn-tree for a nesting site. From the ground, the
nests resemble each other. They are about eight
inches across, are composed outwardly of sticks,
leaves, and moss, lined with fine roots and the like,
and sometimes wood or cotton is used.</p>


<h3>October Twentieth</h3>

<p>Crows usually build in pine-trees, but where
there are no pines, they will choose an oak, chestnut,
maple, or poplar, not always high ones either. The
nest is made of sticks, leaves, bark, and mud, lined
with dried grass or fine bark. Most of the large
hawks make their nests in oak, maple, chestnut, or
beech trees, in the groves or forests. They often
occupy the same nest year after year.</p>


<h3>October Twenty-first</h3>

<p>Of the birds that build in bushes or small trees,
the following are the common species: catbird
(twigs, leaves, and grass, lined with fine roots),
black-billed and yellow-billed cuckoo (a sort of
stick platform with a few dried leaves for a lining),
and yellow-breasted chat (leaves, sticks, and bark,
deeply hollowed and lined with soft grasses). Song
sparrows' nests are very common.</p>

<h3>October Twenty-second</h3>

<p>If it becomes necessary to protect their young,
most birds seem to lose all fear. When surprised
with her brood of chicks, the ruffed grouse and
nearly all ground-dwelling birds will feign injury
and flutter a few feet in front of the intruder,
seemingly in great agony. The cries and actions
are intended to lure you from the young. During
the interval that you are watching or chasing her,
the chicks have fairly melted into the earth.</p>


<h3>October Twenty-third</h3>

<p>The stickleback is a small fish that inhabits the
brackish waters from Cape Ann to New Jersey.
Mr. Hornaday says that the abdomen of the male
has been provided with a gland filled with a clear
secretion which coagulates into threads when it
comes in contact with the water. By means of this,
a hood-like nest large enough for the female to enter
is fastened to the vegetation at the bottom of the
sea, and the eggs are deposited in the nest.</p>


<h3>October Twenty-fourth</h3>

<p>Birds seem to have a common language, so far,
at least, as conveying a warning of danger is
concerned. The appearance of a hawk, or an owl,
will cause a catbird, robin, vireo, or song sparrow
to give a warning note which is at once heeded by
every feathered neighbor within hearing. Instantly
all is quiet until danger has passed.</p>

<h3>October Twenty-fifth</h3>

<p>Grebes are expert swimmers and divers. Before
the invention of smokeless powder, the adult birds
could easily dive at the flash of a gun and were
beneath the surface of the water when the shot
struck. On land these duck-like birds push themselves
over the ground on their breasts, or waddle
along in a very awkward manner. They cannot rise
from the ground, and even when rising from the
water they must flutter over its surface for a long
distance before they are able actually to take wing.</p>


<h3>October Twenty-sixth</h3>

<p>A strong aversion for snakes prevails with many
of us. Most people think that the majority of
snakes are poisonous. In reality the only dangerously
venomous snakes in the United States are the
rattlesnakes (fourteen species), the moccasin, and
the copperhead, and they are not so aggressive as is
generally supposed.</p>


<h3>October Twenty-seventh</h3>

<p>How often the osprey or American fish-hawk is
mistaken for an eagle! The fish-hawk is the only
hawk that will poise in the air and then plunge into
the water for its prey. Unlike the kingfisher, of
which of course it is no kin, it carries its food in
its talons instead of in its beak. In captivity it may
be confined in an aviary with pigeons, quail, and
other defenceless birds, and will not molest them.</p>

<h3>October Twenty-eighth</h3>

<p>The bull-frog, whose legs are considered such a
delicacy, often attains a length of fifteen inches.
Its food consists of insects, small frogs, birds, mice,
and young water-fowl, and one has been killed
which had eaten a bat. Birds have learned to look
upon it as a foe. Bull-frogs are fast becoming
extinct because of the demand for their legs.</p>

<h3>October Twenty-ninth</h3>

<p>The sharp-shinned hawk is smaller in body, but
has about the same expanse of wing, as a domesticated
pigeon. It is one of the few hawks that is
destructive to birds and young poultry. Not only
in the country, but in the city parks and villages,
it is seen in late fall or in winter, skimming over
the tops of the bushes ready to pounce upon a
sparrow of any species the instant one appears.</p>

<h3>October Thirtieth</h3>

<p>Red squirrels and chipmunks differ in size,
markings, and habits. The red squirrel is nearly
twice as large as the chipmunk, it nests in trees, and
is usually seen among the branches. It is red on
the back and whitish beneath, sometimes having
one black line along each side. Chipmunks live
in the ground, hollow stumps, and roots. They
are poor tree climbers and will not jump from tree
to tree unless forced to do so. They have a black
stripe down the back and two on each side.</p>

<p>At dusk or early in the evening the weird, tremulous
wail of the screech owl may be heard. Sometimes
one will visit a favorite tree at the same hour
evening after evening, and after sounding his cry
several times, will glide away into the country to
hunt for a supper of beetles, meadow mice or
white-footed mice.</p>

<h3>November First</h3>

<p>The chipping sparrow, field sparrow, vesper
sparrow, mourning dove, red-shouldered blackbird,
and purple grackle stay with us as long as
the weather will permit. Mr. Chapman says:
"Should the season be an exceedingly mild one,
many of these birds will remain [about New York]
until late in December."</p>


<h3>November Second</h3>

<p>The brown creeper, another denizen of the
forests, groves, and village shade trees, is seldom
noticed because of its small size and dull coloring,
which blends perfectly with the tree trunks. It
is often found in company with chickadees, nuthatches
and kinglets. The creeper flies to the base
of a tree, and winds his way to the top, hunting
in the crevices of the bark for insects and insect
larvæ, occasionally uttering a clear, feeble trill.</p>


<h3>November Third</h3>

<p>Unlike the bears one meets in certain kinds of
animal stories, the real bear is the most easily
frightened of all our large animals. His eyesight
is defective, and his hearing not particularly good,
but his keen nose more than compensates for those
deficiencies.</p>

<h3>November Fourth</h3>

<p>Artists often make the mistake of drawing a
flying bird with its feet drawn up beneath its breast.
Although some birds do hold their feet in this
position, the herons, gulls, buzzards, and most
of the hawks and eagles hold their feet and legs
against the under side of the tail. The legs of the
many species of herons are very conspicuous when
the birds fly, for as the tail is short, they extend
far beyond it.</p>


<h3>November Fifth</h3>

<p>Some ants live in the ground, some make chambers
in wood, while others build mounds of small
sticks, dirt, and gravel, and construct roadways to
and from them. They feed upon flesh, fruit,
and plant substances. Their hind legs are provided
with a sort of brush for cleaning the dirt
from their bodies, and these legs in turn are cleaned
by being drawn through the mouth.</p>


<h3>November Sixth</h3>

<p>The "'coon" (raccoon) is strictly a nocturnal
animal, and spends the day in hollow trees, crevices
in the rocks, or in thick underbrush, coming forth
at night to hunt its food,&mdash;mice, birds, crabs,
clams, eggs, acorns, and green corn. On the Pacific
Coast it makes a neat round hole in the side of a
pumpkin and takes out the seeds with its hands.</p>

<h3>November Seventh</h3>

<p>Hawks, owls, and eagles are bold defenders of
their nests and young. Circling overhead, they
suddenly bow their wings and dash at the intruder,
turning quickly and swooping up again when only
a few inches from his head. Instances are known
in which persons have been wounded severely while
meddling with the property of such birds of prey.</p>


<h3>November Eighth</h3>

<p>The tail of the brown creeper, and of all of the
thirty-five species and sub-species of woodpeckers,
is provided with stiff, pointed feathers which curve
in slightly. With the chimney swift, each feather
is armed with a spine. While woodpeckers cling
to a tree trunk, and the chimney swift to the side
of a chimney, their stiff tails help to support them.</p>


<h3>November Ninth</h3>

<p>Although the darning-needle, dragon fly, snake
feeder, or snake doctor is perfectly harmless,
Howard says, "Some believe that they will sew up
the ears of bad boys; others that they will sting
horses; still others that they act as feeders and
physicians to snakes, especially to water snakes."
They are the beautiful lace-winged insects that
frequently dip down and pick up an insect from the
surface of a pond or a river.</p>

<h3>November Tenth</h3>

<p>Conspicuous in the withered grass of upland
meadows are the white flowers of the several
species of everlasting. If picked before they begin
to fade, they will keep through winter nearly as
fresh and white as when the blossoming season
was at its height.</p>


<h3>November Eleventh</h3>

<p>In the mountains of the North, the black bear
is beginning to look for a suitable place in which to
pass the winter. Many bears could wear their
skins much longer if they would only hibernate
before the snow begins to fly. Every hunter anxiously
awaits the first fall of snow, which makes
the tracking of bears so easy.</p>


<h3>November Twelfth</h3>

<p>Nine out of every ten persons call salamanders or
newts, "lizards." Lizards do not metamorphose;
consequently they are never found in the water.
They are very swift; lovers of the sun, and in the
East are rarely seen north of a line parallel with
southern New England. Salamanders are found
either <i>in the water or in damp places</i>. They metamorphose,
and when on the ground their efforts to
escape are feeble.</p>

<h3>November Thirteenth</h3>

<p>Owls, woodpeckers, ducks, doves, pigeons, the
ruffed grouse, Bob-white, belted kingfisher, ruby-throated
hummingbird, chimney swift, short-billed
marsh wren, and bush-tit lay eggs that are glossy
white or various shades of white or buff-color. The
eggs of the herons, cuckoos, robin, bluebird, catbird,
Wilson's thrush, and hermit thrush are blue,
green, or various shades of those colors.</p>


<h3>November Fourteenth</h3>

<p>Just at evening the white-throated sparrows,
from the thickets, call their sweet, clear good-night
to one another. As the darkness falls, the calls
gradually cease, until only an occasional flutter is
heard as some restless bird, not satisfied with its
perch, chooses a new position for the night.</p>


<h3>November Fifteenth</h3>

<p>It is now time to build winter shelters for Bob-white,
and to begin to feed the winter birds. Cut
pine or evergreen boughs, and pile them against the
side of a log, leaving a <i>small</i> opening at each end
for the quail to enter. Make the shelters on the
south or east side of a hill or bank, where it will be
protected from the cold winter storms. Now scatter
buckwheat about your bird "wickey-up," as an
Indian would call it, and they will soon find it.
You should feed grain to your flock all winter.</p>

<h3>November Sixteenth</h3>

<p>The sparrow hawk is a summer resident in New
England, Pennsylvania, New York, and Ohio. It
nests in a cavity of a tree or in a deserted woodpecker's
nest, and it will return to the same locality
year after year. The bird is no larger than a robin,
and instead of being a sparrow killer, it lives chiefly
upon insects.</p>


<h3>November Seventeenth</h3>

<p>The opossum is the only North American member
of the order Marsupialia which has so many representatives
in Australia and New Zealand. The
marsupials are the animals that have pouches
over their abdomens in which they <i>carry their
young</i>. Some people wrongly include in this order
the pocket gopher, pocket mouse, and other mammals
that have cheek pouches in which they <i>carry
food</i>.</p>


<h3>November Eighteenth</h3>

<p>Accounts of the capture of "extremely rare and
valuable monkey-faced owls," are often published.
These owls are nothing more than barn owls, which
are so common in the Southern States. They nest
in holes in banks, in cavities in trees, or in church
belfries. A pair has occupied one of the towers
in the Smithsonian Institution at Washington, for
several years.</p>

<h3>November Nineteenth</h3>

<p>The common meadow mouse makes a docile and
interesting pet, if captured without frightening or
exciting him. Within fifteen minutes from the time
of his capture he will often lose all fear, and while
you hold him he will wash his face with his paws.</p>


<h3>November Twentieth</h3>

<p>The snowy, and the great-gray, owls, both inhabitants
of the North-land, are the largest American
members of the owl family. They are more frequently
seen in the daytime and are much tamer
than other owls, often permitting one to approach
very close to them. Except in very severe weather
they rarely come below the Canadian border. In
disposition the great-horned owl and the snow owl
are considered fierce, still they can be tamed, even if
captured when adult.</p>


<h3>November Twenty-first</h3>

<p>It is a general impression that bears hug their
victims to death. When enraged a bear will charge
to within a few feet of a man, rise upon its hind legs,
and strike him down with its fore paws, or hold
him with them while it attacks his neck and shoulders
with its teeth. After inflicting several wounds
a bear will often leave its victim without further
injuring him.</p>

<h3>November Twenty-second</h3>

<p>The blue jay is one of the birds who remain
with us throughout the entire year. His habits are
not the same in all parts of his range. In some
localities he is strictly a bird of the forests, while
in others, he is common in our city parks and shade-trees.
A relative of the crow, he is charged with
robbing nests of their eggs and young birds. He
is fond of nuts also, and will eat any kind that his
strong bill can open.</p>


<h3>November Twenty-third</h3>

<p>Hawks and owls will respond quickly if you make
a squeaking noise like a mouse, and a fox will stop
and prick up his ears, then turn and proceed in the
direction of the sound until he discovers its source.
A weasel will dash toward the hunter, and even
after it sees him, its curiosity keeps it from retreating
at once.</p>


<h3>November Twenty-fourth</h3>

<p>The Thanksgiving turkey that we eat about now
"is derived from the wild turkey of Mexico, which
was introduced into Europe shortly after the Conquest
and was thence brought to eastern North
America." (Chapman and Reed.) The tips of
the upper tail-coverts of the domestic and the
Mexican turkey are whitish, while those of the
wild turkey of eastern United States are rusty
brown.</p>

<h3>November Twenty-fifth</h3>

<p>A skunk knows every woodchuck and rabbit
burrow in his neighborhood. In the woods he will
often visit hole after hole with great precision, but
in the meadows he is more apt to follow the fences,
frequently cutting across a corner in order to
shorten the distance to a burrow. Probably experience
has taught him that rabbits are often
found in woodchuck holes and that meadow mice
also take shelter in them during the winter.</p>


<h3>November Twenty-sixth</h3>

<p>The tallest and heaviest of all birds is the African
ostrich, but the condor of South America has the
widest expanse of wing. In the United States, the
California vulture, once very rare, but now steadily
increasing, is broadest across the wings. The
whooping crane stands the highest, and the swans
are the heaviest of our birds.</p>


<h3>November Twenty-seventh</h3>

<p>Do not kill the bats that you find passing the
winter in your garret, or those that fly into your
house in the summer. They destroy large numbers
of gnats and mosquitoes, and do no harm. The
belief that they get into one's hair is ridiculous, and
it is seldom that they are infested with vermin.
A South American species has been known to suck
the blood of horses and cattle.</p>

<h3>November Twenty-eighth</h3>

<p>On returning to the nest and discovering that
a cowbird has laid an egg in it, some species of
birds will roll the egg out. But the ph&#339;be, red-eyed
vireo, chipping sparrow, and yellow warbler
will sometimes cover the eggs with nesting material
and build up the sides of the nest, thus burying its
own and the cowbird's egg. Another set of eggs
is then laid and the bird begins to sit, but the
buried eggs are too deep to be affected by the
warmth of the parent's body, so the "lazy-bird's"
purpose is defeated.</p>


<h3>November Twenty-ninth</h3>

<p>In the abandoned birds' nests that are placed
near the ground in shrubs and small trees close to
hazel-nut bushes and bitter-sweet vines, you will
often find a handful of hazel-nuts or bitter-sweet
berries. They were put there by the white-footed
mice and the meadow mice who visit these storehouses
regularly. Very often a white-footed mouse
will cover a bird's nest with fine dried grass and
inner bark, and make a nest for itself.</p>


<h3>November Thirtieth</h3>

<p>Between now and the first of March you may
expect to see large flocks of red-polls feeding on
seeds among the weeds and low bushes, and cross-bills
in the pine and spruce trees shelling seeds
from the cones.</p>

<h3>December First</h3>

<p>Besides being the means by which they capture
their prey, the talons of an eagle, hawk, or owl
are their weapons of defence. Their bill can
really inflict but little injury. When wounded
one of these birds will throw itself upon its back,
and strike with its feet, burying its talons deep in
the flesh of its adversary.</p>


<h3>December Second</h3>

<p>The gray or wood gray fox lives about the rocks
and ledges. It is a noted tree climber, and, being
less fleet than the red fox, it often eludes pursuing
dogs by taking shelter in the rocks, or amid the
branches of a tree. Running a short distance, it
will spring to the side of a tree and scramble up the
trunk. Sometimes it falls back and is obliged to
repeat the performance several times before it is
able to gain the first branches, from which it can
easily climb from limb to limb as high as it chooses.</p>


<h3>December Third</h3>

<p>The junco and the horned lark in some localities
are called "snowbird," but the snow bunting, or
snowflake, is the only bird correctly so called. These
birds do not look alike, but the appearance of the
three species in large numbers during the winter
is confusing to one not versed in bird-lore.</p>

<h3>December Fourth</h3>

<p>Why is it that most carnivorous animals, as well
as most birds of prey, refuse to eat shrews and
moles? It may be due to the strong pungent odor
of their bodies. Cats will catch them and play with
them, but owls are the only creatures that seem to
care for them for food.</p>


<h3>December Fifth</h3>

<p>Mr. Newhall says that a lady told him that an
Oneida Indian once cured her grandfather of a
severe illness. He afterward learned that the
medicine used was an extract of witch-hazel, and
later prepared and sold it widely.</p>


<h3>December Sixth</h3>

<p>The great-horned owl, hoot owl, or cat owl, is the
only bird that from choice will feed upon skunks.
Although rabbits are abundant and easy to capture,
his Owlship seems to prefer to battle against the
long teeth and disagreeable odor of the skunk in
order to dine upon its flesh. Nearly all owls of this
species that are killed in winter are strongly scented
with the skunk's odor.</p>

<h3>December Seventh</h3>

<p>The two glands that hold the skunk's vile-smelling
fluid are about the size and shape of a pecan
nut. They are strictly <i>organs of protection</i> and are
never used except in <i>extreme</i> cases of defence. They
are situated between the skin and the flesh near the
root of the tail. When brought into use, a number
of strong muscles encircling them contract, and a
fine spray of the fluid is thrown off; the tail taking
no part in its distribution.</p>


<h3>December Eighth</h3>

<p>Snakes are not slimy and clammy; they do not
cover their food with saliva before swallowing it,
and the forked flexible member which darts in and
out of their mouth is not a "stinger," but the tongue.
They do not swallow their young in cases of danger,
and they have no power to "charm," or hypnotize.</p>


<h3>December Ninth</h3>

<p>The bald-faced hornet attaches his large, cone-shaped,
paper nests under the eaves of houses, in
garrets, or to the limbs of trees. Collecting the
minute fibres that adhere to the weather-beaten
fences and buildings, the hornets mix it with saliva
and make a crude quality of paper. To enlarge a
nest, the inside walls are torn away and the material
is used to add to the outside layer. Like bumblebees,
the workers and drones die in the fall, the
queen hibernating.</p>

<h3>December Tenth</h3>

<p>Beautiful as the deer are and innocent as they
seem, they cannot be trusted, as attendants in
zoological parks can testify. A bear will seldom
attack a keeper without provocation, and when he
does he will usually give warning before he charges.
Not so with a buck of the deer family. Greeting
his best friend in the most cordial manner, he may,
without warning, charge when the man's back is
turned, and gore or trample him to death.</p>


<h3>December Eleventh</h3>

<p>The American eagle is more often spoken of as
the "bald eagle," a name which misleads many
people since the bird is not "bald" at all. The top
of its head is as thickly feathered as the heads of
most birds. Probably some one thought that the
white head and neck made the eagle appear bald,
hence the name. The birds reach the third year
before the head and tail begin to turn white.</p>


<h3>December Twelfth</h3>

<p>The little striped skunk, or hydrophobia skunk
of the South, West, and Southwest, is about half
the size of our common skunk. It frequently goes
mad and attacks people with great fury. Cowboys
and other persons compelled to sleep on the
ground in the open have been bitten by it and have
died of hydrophobia. <i>It is the only</i> North American
animal that will deliberately <i>attack a sleeping person</i>.</p>

<h3>December Thirteenth</h3>

<p>"Till a comparatively recent date it was not
certainly known that eels have eggs which develop
outside of the body. Even now the breeding habits
are scarcely known, but it is supposed that the
spawning takes place late in the fall or during the
winter, near the mouth of rivers, on muddy bottoms." (Bean.)</p>


<h3>December Fourteenth</h3>

<p>The so-called glass snake is truly speaking not a
snake, but a legless lizard. It forms part of the food
of the true snakes. Its body is very brittle, a light
blow with a stick being sufficient to break it in two.
Although it is true that another tail will grow
(provided not more than a fourth of the body is
missing), it is not true that the broken pieces will
eventually unite, or that a head and body will grow
on the tail piece.</p>


<h3>December Fifteenth</h3>

<p>How often you read of, or heard some one speak
of, the whale as "the largest of fish." A whale is
a <i>mammal</i>, because it suckles its young. It is not
only the largest of <i>living</i> mammals, but, according
to Mr. Lucas, the large ones are larger than any of
the enormous reptiles that inhabited the world
before the advent of man, and whose fossil remains
may be seen in any of our large museums.</p>

<h3>December Sixteenth</h3>

<p>The quiet little tree sparrows spend the winter
with us feeding on the seeds of weeds and grasses.
You will find their tracks in the snow where flocks
have been eating ragweed seeds, and you are likely
to see some of them fluttering about in the bushes
along the river banks, or in the frozen swamps
uttering a pleasing call note. They can be identified
by the distinct black spot on the breast and their
pinkish bills.</p>


<h3>December Seventeenth</h3>

<p>There is no better time to study the tracks and
nightly doings of animals than after the first fall
of snow. Start early in the morning and see how
many stories the tracks have written.</p>


<h3>December Eighteenth</h3>

<p>Following the tracks of a white-footed mouse in
the woods, they lead you to a hollow log, at the
entrance of which are a number of beech-nut shells,
remains of a midnight feast taken from a winter
store-house. From here the mouse went into the
field, and then the tracks stop abruptly, leaving you
to guess the rest. Possibly one of the several
species of owls that inhabit your locality could
explain the sudden ending of the trail.</p>

<h3>December Nineteenth</h3>

<p>Continuing through the woods, you soon discover
the trail of two birds whose feet are not quite
the size of those of bantam chickens. Following
them a few hundred yards you come to a bedded
spot in the snow, beneath the drooping branches
of a spruce. Not far from here, two ruffed grouse
rise, with a loud whirr of wings, and speed off before
your startled eyes. These are the birds whose
tracks you have been following.</p>


<h3>December Twentieth</h3>

<p>Don't follow a fox track with the intention of
overtaking the maker, unless you have dogs. He
may be ten miles away at that very moment, and
even if you should draw near to him, he is almost
certain to elude your sight by sneaking away.</p>


<h3>December Twenty-first</h3>

<p>You may find where a muskrat has left the stream
and started across the meadow to a marsh near by.
Suddenly a mink's track breaks into the trail and
follows in the same direction, and you soon come to
a spot where the snow is much disturbed, and the
tracks mingle in confusion. Blood-stains on the
snow and matted places show where the two have
fought a battle for existence. A broad, deep trail
leading to a stump indicates that some object has
been dragged across the snow, and there you find
the half-eaten remains of the muskrat.</p>

<h3>December Twenty-second</h3>

<p>What tracks are these, trailing along the fence
between a brush-lot and a buckwheat field? At
the corner of the fence human footprints and those
of a dog join them. All now travel in the same
direction, first on one side of the fence, then on the
other. Finally the bird tracks stop abruptly and
the marks of wings on each side of them show that
the birds have taken flight. The dog has suddenly
bolted, and where his tracks turn back is a dash in
the snow and a few quail feathers which tell the
story; a hunter has bagged his game.</p>


<h3>December Twenty-third</h3>

<p>An open brush-lot bordering woods is the best
place to find cotton-tail rabbit tracks. Judging
from the number of tracks and the spaces between
them, the rabbits have been playing tag, or attempting
to break the record for running and jumping.
They did rest, however, for beneath a bush,
and by the side of a stump, we find impressions in
the snow where they sat down. If it is a warm
day, you are apt to surprise one taking a sun-bath.</p>


<h3>December Twenty-fourth</h3>

<p>Save in the dome of the Capitol, could our
national bird, the bald eagle, select a more appropriate
place for its nest than at Washington's home?
In a patch of heavy timber at Mt. Vernon, Va., a
pair of eagles have nested for several years.</p>

<h3>December Twenty-fifth</h3>

<p>Mistletoe is a parasitic evergreen shrub that is
abundant in the South. It grows in thick clusters
on limbs of various species of trees. Its flowers are
whitish, and after the flowering season, clusters
of white berries take the place of the blossoms. As
the berries are ready to fall, they become soft and
sticky, and when they drop they adhere to the bark
of any limb they strike, and the seeds take root and
are nourished by the sap of the tree.</p>


<h3>December Twenty-sixth</h3>

<p>You might take a Christmas walk over the ice
and visit a muskrat's house of sticks and other
rubbish. If the occupants are at home, you will
notice a frosty spot on one side of the mound. A
muskrat hunter would thrust his spear through the
thin wall and impale one or more of the rats upon
its tines. Many of the clods composing the house
bear the nose-print of the maker.</p>


<h3>December Twenty-seventh</h3>

<p>While sleigh-riding you are likely to see a flock
of trim, sober-colored birds perched close together,
feeding on the berries of the mountain ash tree or
on decayed apples. They have <i>crests</i> and <i>wax-like
red dots</i> on the inner feathers of their wings.
These are cedar-birds, or cedar waxwings. They
often remain with us throughout the year.</p>

<h3>December Twenty-eighth</h3>

<p>"The name 'burl' is applied to all excrescent
growths on trees, except true knots. The origin
of these wart-like swellings is imperfectly known,
but they can generally be attributed to injuries by
woodpeckers, gall insects, and to the irritating and
continued growth of fungi in the woody tissues at
such points." (Adams.)</p>


<h3>December Twenty-ninth</h3>

<p>A flock of pine grosbeaks feeding on buds in a
maple or an apple tree on a cold winter's day is a
pleasing sight for any bird lover. They are the size of
a robin, and the male has a rose-colored head, neck,
breast, and back. They are quiet birds and very
tame, even permitting a person to climb the tree and
approach within a few feet, before they take flight.
It is only during the severest weather that they
migrate south into southern New York, Pennsylvania,
and New England.</p>


<h3>December Thirtieth</h3>

<p>North America can boast of the largest deer in
the world, the Alaskan moose; as well as the
largest of flesh-eating mammals, the Kodiak bear.
We also have more rodents and cats than any other
country.</p>

<p>Sometimes the lakes freeze over, and the gulls
are compelled to seek the large open rivers, and ask
alms from the inhabitants along their banks. At
such times they become very tame, so if you will
place food within their reach, they will soon find it
and call upon you from day to day.</p>
